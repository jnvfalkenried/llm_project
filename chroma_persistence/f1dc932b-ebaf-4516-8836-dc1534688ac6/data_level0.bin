    "review": "This movie is the perfect example of how a post-apocalyptic scenario would look like if it were to happen today. Or any other day nevertheless. I waited quite some time to see this movie and I can say it sort of brought me the joy I expected to deliver. The actors were really good, more than good, especially the one that portrayed Ann. Regarding the plot, it's not an action packed feature film but it has it's moments where it shines. The zombies were actually pretty decent looking and though you might expect to see them everywhere, it's not like that. But they are there, when you don't expect them to appear. One thing I didn't enjoyed was the ending scenes. I think that it could have been something different but it still added to the emotion. All in all, this movie is worth watching for it's idea behind it. It's different from all the other crap zombie movies and approaches this theme in a very unique way.",

The moment we, as a species, stand by and say that a film of this quality, with a name like Monkey Up is okay, is the moment we may as well be monkeys, sat around throwing faeces at each other. Because that's what this film is, it is the cinematic equivalent of throwing faeces in the face of the audience. The acting is beyond terrible, especially the little girl. Child actors get a lot of stick for being bad that they sometimes don't deserve, but this is not one of those times. Almost all the jokes involve saying something, but saying 'monkey' or 'banana' where you wouldn't expect. The plot is the same template used in other Air Bud products (arguably not films) and all special effects look awful. It is not okay to make films like this, just because children will watch them. Firstly, some impressionably young minds will grow up thinking this piece of trash is what a film is supposed to look like, and secondly, their parents will have to watch it with them. Stop defending tasteless garbage designed to exploit gullible young minds for profit. 1/10 is generous for this thing.",

The Julia Roberts subplot is very disappointing, because it could have been so much better. She could have made a touching announcement on TV, which would have a far greater impact on the viewers.

    "review": "\"The Cakemaker\" (2017 release from Israel; 104 min.) brings the story of Thomas, a cakemaker in Berlin whose Kredenz Cafe and Bakery is frequented by Oren, an Israeli guy often in Berlin on business. Even though Oren has a wife (Anat) and young son in Jerusalem, Thomas and Oren start an affair. We then go to \"One Year Later\", and apparently Thomas and Oren live together when Oren comes to Berlin. Then one day, after Oren leaves for Israel, he no longer returns Thomas' calls, and to his horror, Thomas finds out that Oren was killed in an accident. Wanting to find out more, Thomas decides to go to Jerusalem and contact Anat (without revealing to her who he is). At this point we're 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: the movie is written and directed by Ofir Raul Grazier. I can't say that I am familiar with his prior work. But I do know this: \"The Cakemaker\" is one of the best movies I have seen this year. Given the plot-heavy nature of the movie (the key question being: will Thomas reveal to Anat who he really is or will he be found out about?), I am not going to say much more. Well-known and respected French-Israeli actress Sarah Adler is outstanding as the grieving widow. German actor Tim Kalkhof plays Thomas, and does fine. As it turns out, this is a bit of a foodie movie too, featuring German cakes and pastries (I'll have another slice of Black Forest Cake any day!). \"The Cakemaker\" premiered on the film festival circuit in the summer of 2017, and has won near-unanimous critical acclaim. Indeed, \"The Cakemaker\" is one of those rare movies that is certified 100% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. \"The Cakemaker\" opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay, but just okay (about 15-20 people). If you have any interest in a top notch foreign movie with fully developed characters and with a touch of foodie stuff sprinkled in, I'd readily suggest you check out in the theater (if you get a chance), on VOD (more likely) or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion. For me, \"The Cakemaker\" is a WINNER all the way.",

The chemistry between Coco Martin and Vice Ganda is absolutely effective. The fighting scenes in this movie are better than some other serious Action Drama films. It gives justice to the action genre through the production design and choreography. It was satisfying to watch it with laughs but there are some obviously unsettling moods. The supporting love story, JaDine, is out of place. Another problem was the movie trying not to be awkward on drama scenes.

It wants to have something to say about gay issues, teen pregnancy, pedophilia, religion, detached parents, and overly moralistic school boards, but it never digs into one of them below the surface and the whole film becomes sort of like a light episode of Glee.This is not to say that Speech & Debate is without amusing moments, but the laughs aren't big enough to function as a comedy and the drama isn't real or powerful enough to function as a drama. Speech & Debate just sort of...is. In its goal to be inoffensive, light, and watchable for all audiences, it no longer has any bite.This is a Netflix pick at best.",

Also featuring Buddy Duress, Taliah Webster, Barkhad Abdi, Peter Verby, Robert Clohessy, and Jennifer Jason Leigh.Filmed in a gritty manner with over-saturated colors and a relentless electronic score, once this movie gets started it becomes an adrenaline-fueled marathon of tense situations, with Pattinson's character consistently asked to make split-second decisions that go wrong as often as right. I consider Robert Pattinson one of the least impressive movie stars to have sprung up in the last decade, but he acquits himself well here, grungy, desperate and vulpine. All of the supporting characters are believable, although largely unsavory. I wasn't quite as impressed with the end result as some critics, as I felt that the story stumbled to an unsatisfying conclusion, and nothing really added up to much, with events virtually ending where they began.

It's dialogue-faithful, the tone is good, and really, if they've gotten Conroy and Hamill as the two leads, you know they're taking this seriously. And that infamous scene is incredibly effective.But it's that first half-hour that doesn't work. It's tacked-on and certainly doesn't do Batgirl or Batman any favors (the latter of whom just seems a tad creepy). This is (for better or worse) the Joker's origin story, incendiary though it is, and I can understand why they'd want to flesh out Barbara's character; but it still doesn't work because Batman doesn't recall her horrific fate later on in the movie. She's no longer relevant beyond the shock value. The intentions were there, but it could've been done better.Within this running time, there are 45 minutes of good movie.

Just to give you a bit of perspective on where I'm coming from.Personally, I really enjoyed this movie. It captured very well the many different aspects of festival culture, from the bro-tank crowd, to the slutty girls, to the people only there to take an extreme amount of drugs, to the people who come to enjoy the music and hardly if at all participate in the party scene. The chaos and bliss of walking around a massive, multi-staged arena of people who are just there to enjoy themselves in the best way they know how, dancing to the music that we all love. Even the shocking and thrilling experience of running into your best friend in the middle of a crowd, in a festival with 24,000 people in it, something that has actually happened to me, as unlikely as that sounds. The depiction of PLUR was a bit cheesy, not that there is really a non-cheesy way to portray that element. The film also captured a bit of DJ culture, and the constant struggle between the people who are in it for the music vs. the fame, which I appreciated, although that might not resonate so much with the general audience.With a solid combination of outright, and background comedy (pay attention to side characters that are being talked over), and serious plot, this movie is a good example of what a 'dramedy' should be. Without spoiling anything, the plot has enough twists to keep you engaged, although it does grow a bit predictable as it goes. Some parts did seem a bit forced, plot-wise, but that's to be expected in film nowadays.I would have liked if the film had more diversity in the music, as it was almost entirely main- stage house in the soundtrack, but to be fair, that is the only type of EDM that really works with general audiences, so I understand why they choose to stick so closely to the genre.If you've never been to a festival, do not by any means form your opinion of what they are like on this movie, but if you have, sit back and enjoy, and let XOXO take you back to what is, for many people, the most surreal and magical few days of their entire lives.",

The movie constantly jumps around in order to somehow shove along the plot and almost 'get it over with'. There was one scene where with no context or explanation whatsoever the main actors come on in sandwich costumes and a grim reaper costume. There was no previous mention of the holiday or even after to give you the reason of the costumes leaving you to just infer it was halloween or something. I couldn't believe that 1.)

If you're looking for a deep, insightful comedy drama with a bunch of existential messages this is not the movie for you. If you're looking for warm and fuzzy feelings mixed with some sass and charm I recommend this movie. My belly didn't ache from laughing, but my mouth did hurt from smiling so much. If you watch enough movies and TV they all become predictable, but that doesn't have to take away from your enjoyment or the message of self love that this movie leans on. So found a comfy spot on the couch, grab some tea, and let the positive vibes flow.",

    "plot": "Based on the deadly rule of the Khmer Rouge, a communist inspired movement led by the dictator Pol Pot, under which an estimated 25% of the Cambodian population died from malnutrition, forced labour and mass murder from 1975 until 1979. This historical event is today known as the Cambodian genocide.",
    "review": "With such a gut-wrenching subject matter of the Khmer Rouge regime and the memoir being such an emotionally complex read and going full throttle with the horror, 'First They Killed My Father' intrigued from the get go. Also wanted to see how actress Angelina Jolie fared as director, another reason for seeing the film. Saw 'First They Killed My Father' on Neflix a while ago but, as one can tell, it took me a while to get round to reviewing it, due to music commitments, my \"to watch and review\" list getting longer constantly and also that it took a while to gather my thoughts on the film. Can see both sides of the argument of both like and dislike. 'First They Killed My Father' is a very admirable film with a lot of strengths and some very powerful moments, but the memoir and the actual events are much more harrowing.'First They Killed My Father' is an incredibly well made film with some truly beautiful images, evocative production design and atmospheric scenery. Jolie directs more than competently, the visual style is spot on and she does a great job ensuring that the perspective doesn't get too biased or one-sided, like when Loung sees good in the enemy in the scene with the captured soldier. Telling the story through the eyes of a child was a brave choice and makes for a persuasive argument, this way prejudice and politics don't muddle or overshadow the story and the potential trap of being too innocent is thankfully strayed away from.There are moments of great poignancy and power, not just the above scene but also the older sister's murder, the scolding and especially the walk through the blood-stained forest (the closest the film gets to capturing the full horror of what the regime was like). 'First They Killed My Father' is a thought-provoking film too and the message resonates and is still an important one. Loung is a person one identifies with and roots for every step of the way, and Sareum Srey Moch's extraordinary and very touching performance is an enormous part of why.On the other hand, while the restrained approach is laudable and somewhat appreciated rather than going the excessively graphic and potentially gratuitous route, 'First They Killed My Father' doesn't quite go full force dramatically and could have taken more risks. Not be as intrepid in showing the regime's full horrors, which were bloody so the graphic nature actually would have been a valid and necessary approach. Can understand what the film was trying to do, but some genuinely powerful. harrowing and poignant scenes (especially the empathising of the captured soldier, the death of the sister, the scolding and the blood-stained forest) are not quite enough in a film that tends to treat the subject in a way that's too careful, muted and tame. A tighter pace, less of the idyllic lingering shots and images (beautiful they are and some make an emotional impact, but not escaping the traps of self-indulgence, being distracting and not having much to them other than looking good) and more dialogue (which may have given the film more flow and cohesion) would have probably solved this.In conclusion, good admirable film but could have been more. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

    "review": "Ugh. This film is just torturous. It feels like a regular TV drama episode dragged out to become a movie. The concept is nothing new with having \"deja vu/time travel/groundhog day\", I knew that going in, but I was interested how they would differentiate with that concept from others, but this film is just a mess/all over the place/snorefest and takes so much time on the most mundane boring scenes. I was waiting the whole time thinking the movie would get better, but it didn't. The film doesn't even take the \"Deja vu\" concept much at all - it's so poorly done. Maybe the first few minutes of the film seemed like it was going somewhere, but after he goes back to his childhood, it's just a major snorefest downhill from there. It never gets better and the ending is the worst. It spends way too much on this sappy drama of being in childhood, befriending/preventing a classmate from being abused. The biggest problem is it's never explained how he got this supernatural power and how exactly it works - it just happens conveniently whenever it wants to. I can suspend some disbelief, but when there is no basic set of rules or anything laid out, the film becomes weak and boring. If you really want to watch a film about deja vu/time travel, watch: Butterfly Effect, Frequency, Predestination, Groundhog Day, Source Code, Edge of Tomorrow, Looper. I believe this film is also based on an anime. I really don't care for anime and maybe it works as a comic book, but the pacing of this film is just super dragged out and it's just not exciting at all. The lamest part of all is how much mumble jumble boring exposition of them telling instead of just showing it. I'm giving it an extra star just because Kasumi Arimura is super cute. That's all.",

He took his film to the censor revising committee to appeal the decision - thus causing the delay in release.",
    "review": "Calendar Girls review :Take this staple Bhandarkar fare. A supposedly realistic and sordid tale of five models. One gets embroiled in a sleazy IPL like match-fixing scam. Another one turns in to a high society escort to make her ends meet. Still another one uses social media effectively to get sundry bollywood assignments. Girl no. 4 decides to be trophy wife of a philandering multi multi zillionaire. Last one changes her profession to become a TV anchor covering Page 3 type news. Really after a point, it doesn't matter if these girls happen to be calendar models or fashion ramp walkers or even page 3 regulars...cos they are more or less the same characters from the Madhur Bhandarkar formulaic world of cinema.Actually, this film could have passed off as a sequel to any of Bhandarkar's previous efforts like 'Page 3' (2005) or 'Fashion' (2008) or even a 'Heroine' (2013)..its just that he chooses not to create any franchise out of them naming his latest film simply 'Calendar Girls'. But get it straight folks. This is basically a case of same old wine in a not so new looking bottle.Backbiting, sexual exploitation, sleazy deals, career manipulations and adultery are all there. The situations drawn from widely read news items and a negative depiction of anyone and everyone in sight (from corporate honchos to media houses to so called power brokers) might have worked in Bhandarkar's past ('Page 3' in particular was quite insightful) but now these kind of stock plots and stereotype characters only invoke an unwanted deja vu feel. Truly, there's nothing in Calendar Girls that you don't know or haven't seen already.To add to our woes, there is no Priyanka Chopra or a Konkona Sen Sharma or a Kangana Ranaut to liven up the drama and make us overlook some of the dull aspects (like the tacky production value which is Bhandarkar's regular sin). Here, the five calendar girls are as far from acting talent as Antarctic is from aamchi Mumbai. To give Bhandarkar his due, he tries hard to utilise them to the best extent possible but sadly, the girls fail him.The supporting cast has Suhel Seth playing a certain (real life) liquor baron. He does a decent job. Rohit Roy as the hot shot photographer is passable. Suchitra Pillai and Mita Vashisht's characters look like leftovers from Bhandarkar's 'Page 3'. Just like the rest of his 'Calendar Girls' does.....Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

    "review": "I've always considered Keith the real driving force in the Stones, now that I'm aware of how important he was to the creation of songs for the band. There's an audio clip here of him crafting the melody of \"Street Fighting Man\" with his overlaid acoustic guitars and Charlie Watts drumming, where you can pretty much hear the fully-fledged song and Keith then casually says, \"And Mick just came in to finish it off...\", presumably with the lyric and good as Jagger's lyrics often were, there's no question that it's the riffs which really made the songs, at least in my opinion they did.Richards is also the only Stone to make a really good solo album, if you listen to his \"Talk Is Cheap\" and \"Main Offender\" albums, plus he wrote a really good autobiography \"Life\" some years ago so far me, I'd rather catch a documentary on him than his old mate Mick.This Netflix production, as the name suggests, talks to the man about his main musical influences, which in order appear to be the blues, rock and roll, country and reggae music so the film takes him to places like New York, Chicago, Nashville and Jamaica allowing the man to regale us with his love for each musical style as well as inserting some vintage clips not only of some of his own musical heroes like Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry, but also of him interacting with them too. There are some nice anecdotes about how modest Muddy was and how demanding Chuck was although one or two of his other tales appear a little on the tall side.Of course, he had a new record out at the time called \"Crosseyed Heart\", so we get to see him playing with his solo band demoing tracks for the album and chatting informally with his band members. Debunking his caricatured image of the drunken stoner, just as he did in his book, I find a lot of what he says quite sage, especially at the end when he stresses the importance of his family to him. It was warming to hear him talk about reconciling with his twenty-years absent father who'd walked out on him and his mum before he became famous. Occasionally he rambles on a bit about the magic of music and it's obvious that he's the main man the way everybody around him seems to wait for him to stop speaking before laughing with him, plus the producer gets his infrequent collaborator Tom Waits to spout a lot of adulatory BS in Richards' name, but Keith definitely comes over as a decent, grounded guy, as evidenced by him stopping his chauffeured limo to sign autographs for his fans.I'd have appreciated a bit more length and depth to this documentary but you suspect at ten times the length you'd still only be scratching the surface of the man.",

    "review": "Hey, you still have the Manifesto?\nThe what?\nThe Manifesto, man.\nDon't tell me you threw it away.\"Rebirth\" is a psychological thriller of the Netflix collection. I certainly won't deny that I have become a fervent supporter of the Netflix Originals series. I've seen already some great movies (\"Spectral\", \"iBoy\", \"Before I Wake\" and \"Message from the king\"). And also some less successful experiments (\"Mute\" and \"Death note\" eg). \"Rebirth\" is a special case and ends somewhere in the middle. In essence, it's not such a bad movie, but there were certain aspects that made me really hate it. Some will even find it an annoying film. I still don't know whether I should take this film seriously or not. If it was meant to be serious and tried to create an image of how similar organizations function, then it was rather frightening. If, however, it was meant to be satirical, I guess I haven't noticed it then. For me it wasn't really funny.For Kyle (Fran \"The Living\" Kranz) every day is a duplicate of the previous day. He can be seen as a settled and satisfied model citizen who carries out his day-to-day job. This seemingly carefree existence is thoroughly shaken up the day his crazy, hyper-kinetic ex-school friend Zack (Adam \"Once upon a time in Venice\" Goldberg) turns up in Kyle's office and reminds him that they once wrote down a promise. A \"Manifesto\" with one important slogan : \"Don't be boring\". And that's something Kyle, after agreeing to go to some bizarre reorientation weekend, is told several times. Unfortunately, \"Rebirth\" turned out to be somewhat boring with a disappointing final piece.Fran Kranz convincingly plays the confused and panicky Kyle, who sees his smooth going civilian life reduced to a chaotic, uncontrollable nightmare. It's obvious the propagated message of the \"Rebirth\" program is all about self-control. \"Rebirth\" is about getting a grip on yourself and not apathetically following the course of the system (as zombies). According to Zack, it's all about rediscovering yourself and start loving life back again. The only thing Kyle seems to experience is that it's an insane and degrading program. The fact that Zack looks as if he has eaten too many psychedelic mushrooms, doesn't seem to help him either.To be honest, the film really got on my nerves at certain moments. For example, there is the dazzlingly handsome Naomi (Nicky Whelan) who has the annoying habit of answering every question with a question. It was driving me crazy. The exaggerated group events also felt like a sort of mass hysteria. And it became a bit too predictable when Kyle ended up in a pillow-filled room with a couple lovely, very tasty looking women whose sex lives are clearly as exhilarating as watching a chess game. It looked like a hippie commune. It also felt rather surreal and unearthly.As I said before, specially the end is disappointing. Initially, you see an organization trying to recruit members by means of brainwashing and psychological pressure. I admit it was intriguing. But in the end it felt incomplete. Perhaps also due to the lack of any explanation. Initially, \"Rebirth\" looked like a sort of sect, full of esoteric ideas and dogmas, with the aim of allowing the participants to experience a rebirth in which all connections with their inculcating, self-centered living environment are cut. It wants to hold an imaginary mirror up to them and show that the participants are living in an artificial world controlled by others. That they are puppets in a social puppet theater where others pull the strings. Or also, an artificial bubble that you don't want to pierce because of the comfort, their acquired status and financial security. Afterwards, it seems to be nothing else than a cheap sales organization of food products, which they try to sell through networking at well-organized home parties. In the end it felt like I had just attended a Tupperware demonstration.",

Quite frankly, and as several of the other reviews on IMDb are mentioning, this is a clear case of propaganda that the actual Azhar is trying to indulge in.The famous match fixing scandal of the 90s dragged in some big players, both in SA and in India. The legal cases against them were substantiated, and these individuals were subsequently banned from the game for varying periods of time. Are we questioning the calibre of the courts when we try to show these folks, several years later, as upright? Seems kind of 'easy to portray, but difficult to believe'.Azhar was first and always a cheat. In the game, in his marriage, in his relationships with his children (the famous affair with Jwala Gutta, who was his son's friend), and otherwise. Following the debacle in cricket, he went where most goons go - to politics. No guesses into the affiliation he sought and achieved.Now coming to the movie. The acting is unconvincing. The plot is poor. Great actors wasted. Dialogues are juvenile, at the best. Melodrama misplaced. The characters are shallow. The direction a guffaw.As a final statement, I'd like to say that there was no research. This is just the case of a cheat who is trying to show the world he was victimized, when it was actually the reverse. The scenes seem purported from La La Land.1 star out of 10 is what this deserves.",

The music in his movies always stand apart this could also be seen, as a highlight in this undertaking. Rangoon is set up in the pro-independence India. This movie is different from his earlier Shakespearean outings Haider, Omkara and Maqbool. The Cinematography is excellent. The music is as usual the high point of the movie. Leading cast is excellent, with Saif again portraying frightening and is reminiscent of langda Tyagi from Omkara.Shaid deserves an applaud not as superlative performance as in Haider but still top notch.Kangna again shows why she is considered as a queen of Bollywood .

The last 20 to 25 minutes of the movie struggles and make it tedious for the viewers.The climax is elongated and gives an unscrupulous taste to the movie. Overall an highly ambitious project from Vishal but the climax could have been glossy and absorbing which has always been a forte of his earlier movies. Also, regulars in Bhardwaj's flicks the likes Irfan Khan and KK Menon are missed. Overall a good watch",

    "review": "Goldstone could have been a far better movie than the interesting one it is. As a pastiche of several other classics along the lines of; Bad Day at Black Rock, Shane, Magnificent 7, and others, it ambles on to tell a fairly conventional but interesting story of corruption and moral decay set in an outback mining village (often referred to as the 'Town') The multi-talented writer, director, cinematographer, editor and score composer, is Queensland born (to an Aust Indigenous mother and Croatian/German Father) Ivan Sen. Mr Sen has perfected the look of many trend-setting movie makers as well as some of his own unique touches. This should hold the patient viewers interest with its superb desolate landscapes and settings but falls somewhat short with odd, foolish touches - such as an over the top shootout where the neighborhood miners carry on performing menial out-door tasks while serious heavy- gunfire rains mercilessly around them (if this was supposed to be John Wayne type humour, it doesn't work). A strong character performance by indigenous performer Aron Pederson as the investigating detective is weakened from his being eternally paralytic - leaving himself way too vulnerable to the deadly situations he's working within. The business 'crooks' all tend to be clich\u00e9d and rather one dimensional, while their henchmen are too gung-ho Americanised. The predictable & needless over-use of four-letter words becomes tiresome and the walk-away-from gunfire ridden car smash-up (while well done) is a stretch, to say the least. But, all that aside, it's a good-looking, attention holding, Technicolour/Noir, Modern Aussie Western \u2013 that could have been a social conscience classic.",

The set up for these characters and their plot is well put together enough to be engrossing. And the set pieces are just excitingly executed. The film is unafraid of showing something terrible from their consequences. Though there is one point at the third act where I wished the film had ended. It gets to feel a little too long as it goes on, but man, the train sequence alone is one hell of an exercise for suspense. The production is also too impressive and the acting is quite engaging. Overall, it's a dark and brutal, yet quite an edge of your seat cinematic thrill ride.",

Rather than covering it up, make-up artists Jacqueline Knowlton and Ronan convinced the writer and director Greta Gerwig to leave it visible to differentiate this movie from most other coming-of-age dramas full of teenagers with perfect skin. Gerwig concurred.",
    "review": "Offbeat and off brand, Greta Gerwig's 2017 major studio directorial debut 'Lady Bird' is a tale of angst, stress and a strive for perfection and acceptance. The 2002-set film showcases Sacramento in all its glory - or perhaps, lack thereof - and puts Academy Award-nominee Saorise Ronan in the driver's seat to make an impact on audiences.Think of it as a more mainstream, female 'Napoleon Dynamite,' the themes in 'Bird' are common ones that many young adults can identify with during the confusing, competitive high school years. At the center of the film is Ronan's title character (n\u00e9e, Christine), who stops at nothing to escape her hometown for the east coast while battling her mother, Marion (Laurie Metcalf). This rivalry dominates the entire film and helps us understand how one's environment growing up can have a major impact on their choices in life. Between jumping out of moving vehicles, disrupting assemblies at her Catholic high school and struggling with early love, Lady Bird stumbles her way through senior year in pursuit of being part of the \"in crowd.\"Of course, this premise offers Gerwig a lot to work with, and her signature dramedic, deadpan tone is a constant throughout 'Bird.' Everything from the way scenes are shot to the quirky music selection are dripping with proverbial eye rolls, and they all work. Sure, there are a few moments that could cause general audiences gasp, but most of them are done in a way that is not mean-spirited or in poor taste. Aside from Ronan's A+ performance, others in the supporting cast don't disappoint, from Lucas Hedges to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.'Lady Bird' was not a monster hit, but it has the building blocks to become a cult classic for this generation, similar to the way 'Dynamite' did nearly 15 years ago, and sets up Gerwig and Ronan to become even bigger stars than they already are.",

Veteran actor John Arcilla does a solid portrayal as the nationalistic and combative general who treads the murky and complicated paths of war and politics. Fine battle scenes and period uniforms add color and pageantry in this well-acted melodrama.

    "review": "Great movie, great love story! The scenes are so refreshing. Cinematography is tasteful! The actors Enrique Gil & Liza Soberano are so pleasing to the eyes of the viewers. Their chemistry is undeniably perfect, and they can really, I mean really act. Romantic drama is truly one of their strengths. Gerald Anderson is the perfect pick for the third party for the love triangle. He did Tristan (his character) justice. The movie is wholesome (rated G) and we were able to bring our two girls to watch it with us. They enjoyed every minute of it! Well recommended to everyone! You will get out of the movie house with smiles in your faces.",

    "plot": "Vladimir Putin's character was cut from the film before an actor was cast for the role. Putin, who was just three months into the job as Russian president when the tragedy occurred in 2000, was slated to appear as a supporting character in at least five scenes in the film. According to The Hollywood Reporter, EuropaCorp's president, Luc Besson, wanted to shift the story's focus to the rescue mission rather than the politics behind the disaster. One theory is that nobody at EuropaCorp wanted to be hacked. \"Remember The Interview (2014)?\" a source said, referring to the Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen-directed comedy that angered Kim Jong-un and is believed to have sparked the infamous Sony hack in 2014. Ironically, the Russian leader is sympathetically portrayed in the original Kursk script, which highlighted why he took the tragedy personally (Putin's father was a submariner).",
    "review": "It tells the story of 23 survivors on a Russian submarine, and how the rescue mission is handled by the government. It is a sad story, which makes it even more engaging. It is an emotional rollercoaster that takes you to a hopeful up, then a desperate down. The process is then repeated, and tears are likely to fall from viewers' eyes.",

When Alyia swishes a knife from behind a flimsy gold curtain,As the movie goes on it works its magic on you - you buy into the sheer panic, chaos and fear of those involved, never really knowing which way things are going to fall and so the suspense builds slowly but deadly.The make up is actually not at all bad, the special affects ever so slightly rough round the edges reminding you of Blair Witch, but the greatness of this overall movie absorbs its weaker points.I would definitely recommend this movie to horror or thriller or supernatural fans .... and I wont ever be using the word 'Damn' again ... you know .... just in case !!!!!",

    "review": "Moonlight is one of the most beautiful and heart-wrenching films that I have ever seen. Many users are expressing disdain or presumed it to be dull. Yet, to see it as such misses the whole point of the film. Moonlight wasn't intended to overtly wow us or give us knowledge about something we didn't already know. Rather the film allowed us to enter and follow a life that I'm sure many have never considered living. Yes, we know some about poverty, queerness, masculinity, and Blackness individually, but to see the conflict of it all so succinctly woven together allowed the complexity of some folks lives to be seen in an unadulterated way. Moonlight wasn't supposed to give us some grandiose finale or even answers, but simply present a narrative that we often don't see. And that's what makes it so simple, painful, yet outstandingly beautiful. It's also important to remember that just because you don't understand something, that doesn't mean it is unimportant or invalid. Just because you can't relate to the entire story doesn't mean pieces of it can't teach you something about life. Just because the narrative is one that isn't widely told, doesn't mean it should be disregarded. If you don't understand this film or find it a waste, look deep inside yourself and ask why. 10/10 would recommend.",

Even smaller roles are played wonderfully by each of the actors.As it happens, I've recently seen some new Australian movies and now, this show. And all I can say is: Bravo!.

It is a touching film and that is the result of the final confession of director but , the high desire to impress is, in few scenes, too much. Sure, it is a film for see.

This movie mixes slapstick humor with a touch of dark revenge and tops it off with real emotional struggles that most can relate to. But what made the movie, for me at least, was how well cast it was. Joey Kern, being the writer and director, seemed to be able to portray the heartbroken, emotionally torn male lead in a way that only the creator of the character could. Aside from Kern, it was interesting to see characters like Adam Brody and Pablo Schreiber in different roles than what may be considered their usual like in The O.C. or Orange Is The New Black. Brody seemed to not hold anything back, even getting slightly creepy, as a very James-Franco-type crazed best friend.

But these minor flaws did not affect my final rating.I believe there could have been more told to the story and more emotional scenes in the movie as I've seen in other Turkish movies.In conclusion the movie had a powerful message told with a touching story that could have been further emotionally elaborated.

After reading the synopsis about three people going to Johannesburg, or Joburg for short, none of them prepared for what to find there, we can expect sort of a mystery tour through the city. Better still: we get three such tours, a few times crossing each other's paths, while following three people (four, as one has a little girl with her). Their respective backgrounds as well as their mission in Joburg are shown to us in some introductory scenes, demonstrating most of all their unpreparedness for their tasks ahead.In the seemingly lawless parts of the city, it looks very well as if our protagonists are all doomed to end nastily, or at best to return \"tail between legs\" healthy but missions unfulfilled. They are going downhill from the start, and get deeper in trouble with every step. The world where they come from, is very different from what they find here in Joburg, where survival of the fittest is the norm. In short, the very opposite of the \"one for all, all for one\" principle. Initially they don't see their problematic situation yet, and trust the people they meet as they are used to do where they came from. Important in this context is to note that, the whole movie long, there is no sight of any authority, police force, or anything else that can enforce laws and other rules of engagement.All in all, an interesting sightseeing tour, not so much for the architecture but rather the people living there and how they interact, most of the time self-serving their own interests, yet a few times helping each other but not as a matter of course. The screenplay is well designed, even the man in the phone booth who we see appear a few times in the beginning, despite his initial defiant attitude, gets an important and positive role in the end. Finally, two small facts I learned from the Q&A. A lot of stories are combined in this movie, so \"based on true stories\" is true but it is not possible to provide for a solid reference to one book or some such. The title Vaya translates to: Go Away.",

The energy is difficult not to capture from Timberlake who, however you feel about his songs, is a massively talented singer and who makes sure to give these people who likely paid several dozen arms and legs and other limbs to make it to see his live (final on this tour) performance with this great back- up band. But what Demme adds to the equation is genuine human interest and a sense of cutting and framing that is unparalleled; seriously, if Scorsese had directed this it wouldn't have been as interesting as what Demme does.",

Ned is not sport minded and as such is an outcast being sneered at for being 'gay'.Then new boy Connor arrives under a cloud from his previous school. Only he is also a top rugger player and gets placed in the same room as Ned. The Jock and the 'gay' are not best suited and neither boy is happy. However, the two soon form a bond based on mutual interests but it soon becomes apparent that the natural order of things is only allowed to be in flux for so long before the forces, that be, must exert themselves and return everything to its proper place.Now this is a film supported by The Irish Film Board and has a cast peppered with talent including Ardal O'Hanlon, Moe Dunford ('Vikings') and Amy Huberman ('Moone Boy') and everyone puts in good performances. It can be light hearted and lack in character development in places, but it is a well rounded drama which focuses on those that we chose to exclude and how that fear of revulsion changes a person \u2013 and not always for the better. It is a scenario that is familiar to many and not one that any of us ought to be proud of for taking part in. It is also a ruddy good watch with perfect timing and drama to keep you hooked till the credits roll \u2013 easily recommended.",

    "review": "'KILL RATIO': Three Stars (Out of Five)A low-budget B-action flick; about a badass American covert operative, that's trying to defend the president of a poor European country against a ruthless military takeover. The film stars Tom Hopper, as the heroic badass, and it costars Amy Huberman, Lacy Moore, Nick Dunning, Brian McGuinness and Luke Pierucci. It was directed by Paul Tanter (a veteran of the genre), and it was written by Steven Palmer Peterson (a debut screenwriter). The film reminds me of the type of bad B-action flick I grew up on (one of the less memorable ones though); so in some ways it's kind of nostalgic, but it's mostly just bad. Hopper plays James Henderson, a highly skilled (and somewhat witty) U.S. covert operative; that's on assignment in a small European country (with an unstable democracy). The country has recently elected a new President (Moore), who promises to bring new hope to the people there. The general of the corrupt country's military, General Lazar (Dunning), wants to do away with the new democracy though; by killing the President, and anyone else that gets in his way. He didn't count on James Henderson though (of course).The film is exactly like so many 80s action movies that I watched as a kid, the kind that used to play repeatedly on TBS (most of them starring Chuck Norris or Dolph Lundgren). Hopper is definitely charismatic in the lead, and he thinks he's pretty funny. He doesn't have what it takes to be a big star though, but he could definitely keep doing direct-to-video movies like this (and TV, which he's already doing). The director and writer should probably stick to this genre as well. The movie is mildly entertaining, but I think you have to be a pretty big fan of the the genre to even get that out of it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GhHTPB4y30",

But among all of them I would rate this at the very bottom. So watch it only if you find absolutely no other alternatives in the genre.\nWhile most modern scandinavian series looks like they came right from the cinema with great cinematography this whole thing looks kind of cheap. And the whole thing feels a bit cheap too. There is something very odd and very off with the whole pacing. The plot is nothing special, it has few surprises, and it is hard to care for or root for any of the characters.\nThe whole thing drags along in a very slow tempe. Which I usually dont mind that much if it builds up to something great. But this doesnt. Instead it makes you watch it spend at least half its running time watching drug addicts and a alcoholic whine, cry and being drunk/drugged down. And you dont really care what happens to them. Too little time is spent on the crime-aspect of this crimes-seires.\nThis is the only scandinavian series I am sorry I didnt give up right away instead of suffering with it all the way through. After binge-watching this last weekend I was unsure if I wanted to watch anything at all this weekend. But thankfully I gave \"Kalifat\" a chance and that one is everything this is not. And it gave me my faith back in scandinavian crime-series.",

California teachers have great insurance (and family members are all covered), teachers aren't ever just \"let go\" (there's a very strong teacher's union and something called \"due process\"), and speaking of: where was the union rep? Come on...half of the women in CA are teachers or public school administrators, and a quarter of the men are. It wouldn't take a deep dive in a research library to find this information out. So lazy. Even if you can suspend judgment for an hour and a half, don't. This film just isn't good.",

    "review": "This is a decent film. There's not a whole lot that's memorable about it, but it's not terrible by any means. There's a good chemistry between the two lead actresses and the actor who plays the son holds his own. There are a few moments of decent tension throughout, but nothing that really made me jump or put me on edge. Depending on who the viewing audience is, I think it could be rather effective. I liked the fact it didn't follow all the standard tropes you might expect something like this to fall into. That was a pleasant surprise for me. The movie moves along at a good pace and the short runtime is actually to its benefit. I think any longer and there would have been too many 'hurry up and get moving' moments.It seems this was done on a lower budget and there are times when it's obvious, but it doesn't affect the story so I can give it a pass when it comes to those moments. I'll warn you if you're a gore hound and looking for a lot of gore, this film has next to none. If you're looking for everything to be telegraphed and laid out for you, you may not enjoy it. There's a lot left up to the viewers to figure out and piece together. But, it's a horror/thriller and I personally don't really need everything explained, I can just go with it. I know that's not the case for everyone. So, be warned, if you're that type of viewer, you might want to skip it.",

Then, some rich family tension over who will lead the company into the future and the current, female head fighting cancer. Also, some revenge from past misdeeds and you have a few plot arcs to watch.The story is a bit uneven. Some things just didn't make sense, so you just have to accept and look past them. The relationship between the two main characters, Qiao Sheng Yu (Joe Cheng Yuan Chang) and Jiang Ke Xin (Lulu Xu), is awkward, but I think it is supposed to be awkward. I have seen relationships like that in real life. There is the childhood friend, Chi Bo Yuan (Jiro Wang), who tries to defeat their romance, right up until the end. The revenge is mostly embodied in Ke Xin's evil rival Manni (Viann Zhang).The ending, like most Asian dramas, feels a little rushed. Events happen quickly, with little explanation, in the last few episodes. Most of the characters experience growth and change, although much of that is in the last episode when they are trying to tie things up (denouement). This drama will surprise you, then show you what happened, in a flashback, that you didn't see.Overall I enjoyed watching it enough to finish it, so good, but not great.",

    "plot": "Director Oz Perkins includes a few nods to his late father, actor and singer Anthony Perkins, in this film. For example, he includes the song \"You Keep Coming Back Like a Song,\" which is performed by Anthony. Another is a clip from the film \"Friendly Persuasion,\" which starred Anthony.",
    "review": "I would describe 'I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House' as a Gothic short story (or maybe even a Gothic poem) brought to the screen. But forget about all the tropes and visuals that are associated with this genre, it is instead focused on what for me is the essential element of Gothic literature: The dead are alive. This doesn't seem like much to build a narrative on, and the driving force of \"Pretty\" indeed is not plot, nor characters, nor the solving of a mystery. And while all three things are embedded into its narrative it is first and foremost a tone poem. An important thing about the the-dead-are-alive notion, especially in this film, is that it goes both ways. The living can sense the presence of the dead (AKA ghosts), but the dead actually live on after their death, probably mostly concerned with reliving their past, but they might also be able to sense the living. So who is haunting who?Consequently \"Pretty\" presents a ghost story within a ghost story, to put it in simplified terms. In more concrete terms the plot concerns Lily, a nurse who stays in the house of elderly horror fiction writer Iris Blum, to take care of her until her death, which shouldn't be too far into the future now. But it also wouldn't be too wrong to say that the main character is the house that had a few occupants over the course of its lifetime. I don't mean this in the tired old this-and-that-place-is-like-another-character-in-the-film way, the personality of the house certainly is made up of all the people who lived in it. But writer-director Oz Perkins takes the expression \"If these walls could talk\" and makes it a reality. It is about the people who lived in the house (or more correctly the people who died in it), but for all intents and purposes the main character is the house itself.\"Pretty\" starts with nurse Lily's first day at the house and her opening narration tells us that she just turned 28 years old, but that she will never be 29. She talks about death, memory and says \"From where I am now, I can be sure of only a very few things.\" One of those things is her name. So right from the beginning we know that Lily (at least Lily as a narrator) is already dead. Logic dictates that what we see on screen are her hazy memories of her short time in the house. Can we trust her words and can we trust what we see? In any case, old Iris Blum doesn't talk much. But she keeps calling Lily by the name of Polly. And Lily seems to sense some ghostly presence in the house. Polly, as we soon learn, is the main character of Blum's most famous novel \"The Lady in the Walls\", a novel of which Blum said it lacks an ending because of \"an obligation to be true to the subject\" for Polly didn't tell Blum about her ending, but Blum tells us that she is convinced that \"as endings go, Polly's was not an especially pretty one.\" Incidentally there also slowly emerges an ugly, moldy stain on one of the walls in the house that Lily grows concerned about. Is there some connection? Perkins leaves the viewer in the dark for most of the film's running time about the concrete connections between all the characters, as slow and eventless as the whole thing is it is difficult to keep track of all the points of view. For example Lily isn't the only one whose voice-over we hear, we also hear and see young Blum as she writes the novel, and we hear and see Polly. Those voices also aren't particularly easy to distinguish, and it gets even more complicated when scaredy cat Lily finally dares to pick up \"The Lady in the Walls\" to read at least parts of it, the content of which is told from both Blum's and Polly's point of view. Through the viewer's natural desire to know the answers the film evokes ideas on the way as we contemplate all the possible answers. Did Polly really exist? Is she buried behind the wall? Are Lily and Polly somehow the same person? Is Lily a fictional character altogether? Or is Lily only imagining things? Like a poem or a song it evokes first and foremost a tone, a mood, and sparks ideas of what it might be about. It takes further readings/listens to find that in between all the lines it actually tells a story, a simple story perhaps, but nevertheless a story. And this is actually how 'I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House' worked for me. The tone and the ideas immediately took hold of me, but it took me two viewings to really make sense of the narrative. This isn't without its drawbacks, because frankly it isn't so much difficult to follow because it floods you with information that you need to sort out, on the contrary, it basically is so eventless that it poses a challenge to stay attentive for the whole time. This was, however, clearly a conscious choice by Perkins, and his approach is nothing if not consequential. But it makes criticisms of the film being \"boring\" particularly understandable in this case, \"Pretty\" indeed is very one-note, and unless it is a note you relish or that you learn to relish, it won't be enough for you to satisfyingly get you through a whole feature film.As it turned out after two viewings, the solution to the mystery is quite concrete and surprisingly not at all convoluted. Nevertheless the ending for me is as chilling as it is simple, and it beautifully circles back onto itself, like a chorus that keeps coming back, just what you would expect a story told by a ghost to be.",

I've watched over half of this series so far and I feel that it is in no way a \"rip-off\" of these other shows. This is a review about Cannon Busters so I will focus on the show primarily, but it is important to understand that the plot was based on a comic series, the art style did change a bit from then but it is definitely a new show that has some great action scenes and a fantastic English dub as well. Overall, the series holds my attention and has interesting characters to follow. Sometimes the use of CG animation can detract from the aesthetic that I feel the show is striving for, but it is nothing egregious like some other recent anime shows. The dialogue in the show is not bad by any means, as the delivery from the voice actors is pretty strong, but the lines can feel as though they are there kill run time or set up for the next scene more than contribute to the show. In the end, I really like what I've seen from this show and I hope that others will give it a watch too. It's not an instant classic or anything but it is quite good and can be a fun watch depending on the kinds of shows that you may be into as it is action oriented.",

First thing Dangal has going for it is Aamir khan.\nAamir khan gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Phogat. He is the best actor in bollywood. Period. He shocked me by his transformation. I myself being a gym trainer knows the effort which goes in such kinda transformation. Without Aamir I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has.\nThe child actors were good too. The music was good. The direction by Tiwari was the best of 2016. This movie was never boring and full credit shud go to the director. The cinematography gave you a feeling as if what you are watching is real.\nOverall you don't have to like wrestling or know wrestling to appreciate this movie. Its a wonderful movie. The movie is written very well. Superb screenplay n crispy editing.",

And the second movie has a lot of these hilarious discussions and situations, which makes it ( in my opinion) as good as the first one, but only if you have seen and enjoyed the first one.\nI would not recommend watching this movie without having seen the first one, if you are unsure if you will like it.",

    "review": "The rainy nights and the warm glow just enhances the moodiness and coziness of the movie. This beautifully named movie features an equally beautiful cast, who can speak with their eyes. The lead actor plays a cab driver in a big city (not sure which one, if at all it was mentioned), who chances once, upon his childhood sweetheart as a passenger, who initially doesn't recognize him, but eventually does and then slowly becomes his regular passenger. A short flashback from their childhood and their current soft interactions with even fewer words, stolen gazes, mostly from the guy towards the girl, spread over many nights, as he makes excuses to pick and drop her between her home and workplace fills most of the run time. She seems somewhat out of his league, but we are hopeful of a budding romance developing, as time progresses and their interactions increases. There are scenes where the actors are silent and their hesitant thoughts and feelings are apparent through their eyes and face. The director(s) have captured it very well, in fact I re-winded and re-watched these silent bits, which speak a lot without the aid of words.The movie has no song or dance, but there are bits of old Tamil and Hindi songs playing over the radio in the cab, increasing the nostalgia quotient. It does have some expletives in Hindi at the beginning and once after the midway point.It's good this movie was made. Even though it seems to be set in the current day, it had a charm from the older, simpler times, and almost like reading a lovely book. Interestingly, at the end, it credits many people who partially crowdfunded it. Wonder how was the campaign sold to those people. Hope we see more of such independent movies",

    "review": "Not something you see everyday, trust me. Part pubescent teen drama, part authentic horror and part whimsical fantasy. Do they all blend together to create an original piece of indie magic? Unfortunately not. A young girl is raised in captivity residing in a remote woodland cabin. She is discovered and must adjust to modern culture whilst on a journey of self-discovery. The initial hurdle that the film needed to jump was originality. It being an contemporary indie flick allowed the art to come forward and convey themes of motherhood and maturity in creative ways. However, despite the best of intentions it was all too familiar with inconsistent narrative tonality. 'Mama' meets 'Room' would be an apt description for the plot. Taking the fairytale horror from the former and embedding it into dramatic scope from the latter. The two didn't blend, at all. The separation from the first half to the second half was resolute. A simple *click* and the narrative shifts as if we are watching two short films consecutively. For what it's worth, both halves were independently engaging. The fantasy horror elements were produced with authentic makeup and succinct gore while the dramatic character development was thoroughly explored. A fantastically committed central performance from Powley who was enigmatic throughout. Wouldn't be surprised if she turned vegetarian after this. Tyler on the other hand, not so much. I just find her weak in everything. She lacks the \"oomph\" required to elevate the drama. The most unconvincing sheriff ever. Some character relationships, particularly Anna and Ray, were underdeveloped and came across as rushed. I wasn't invested in the chemistry thus consequently resulting in me becoming disinterested in the metaphorical subtext that B\u00f6hm attempted to convey. I always say indie films are hit and miss with me, sadly this is a miss. By all means a well produced flick with some interesting genre blends, just bites off more of the hamburger than it can chew. What can I say, not every film is to my taste.",

It's as if the movie was made just to add a sequel to its predecessor, Heneral Luna. Plot was already known to every one yet the movie was a bit dragging to the point that too unnecessary emphasis on Goyong's love story was made (it was kind of annoying, to be honest). It could also have been better if air time spent on the aforementioned was focused more on the Filipino's efforts to fight the Americans.On the bright side, credits should be given as the movie successfully showed his vulnerability as a young general. His struggles on how to maintain sanity with a large amount of responsibility given to him was also tackled (e.g. him being constantly reminded as the \"agila\" by his older brother). Another good part in the movie was the part where the Filipinos started their journey in Tirad Pass. Hunger and lack of unity among them was shown. This, for me, subtly implied that one of the reasons why we were conquered by Americans before was the lack of solidarity amongst us - a single goal but different means and desires. Furthermore, it was illustrated that selfishness and greed are also major contributors to Philippines failing to protect its freedom from Americans. It's sad to see that up until now; it's these traits that we Filipinos have are what remain in our hearts. All in all, movie was good but below expectation. It could have been done better.",

    "review": "Saw this at the Rotterdam film festival 2017 (website: iffr.com). The synopsis on the festival website contained ample pointers to avoid this movie, for example \"life revolves around vying for popularity, hanging out, falling in love and looking for kicks\". Luckily there was only little attention for partying, courting, clothes, and more such, unlike other movies covering youngsters of high-school age. The real drama took some time to develop, but once becoming apparent it stayed in the forefront, and so should it be.A bit problematic (for me) is that the finale went a bit too fast and too bloody for my taste, something that did not follow logically from what happened before. It seemed a bit over the top. On the other hand, a different ending was not easy to think of, as involving the police and the legal system would have ruined the story completely. Moreover, it would require bringing in the parents of our main protagonists, which usually does not bode well for the clarity of the drama. Anyway, unexpected turns of events came at a steady pace and without weak moments, one step after another. The role of the female college students was less cultivated, as if they were only background tapestry, or maybe serving as catalyst material to speed up developments but otherwise not really crucial for the outcome.Unclear is the opening scene where a deer is found dead in the class room with a broken window. It took some time before the police entered, who started exchanging glances with each other, but I'm at a loss what it all meant.From the final Q&A I learned a nice statement: \"planting little seeds here and there is the essence of script writing\". And also: Rhythm and pacing are important (it was a side answer to a question about the sound track, but even more applying to the screenplay).Also from the Q&A: A serious attempt was made to give Josh more dimensions in his character. Same for the others, though they did not need it that much. All were nice young men without really bad habits, but only nice is not enough to keep our interest.All in all, I was glad to have booked tickets for this movie, despite my fears that it was to become another coming-of-age story with too much time devoted on courting and partying. This time there were no problems along that line. It sustained a real focus on the central story and its pacing of subsequent developments. The audience awarded this movie a mediocre 73rd place (out of 172) with an average score of 3.905 *out of 5).",

It was like the director had a week to shoot the movie and this is what came out. Acting was exaggerated and by that I do not mean to say I expected a whole lot of dramatic acting in a comedy movie. However, the acting of especially Rasim Oztekin was such a disaster. I know this guy from many movies where he was like a king, yet, it felt like he was kidding me in this movie. I do not think all these extra high volumed voices and shouting are needed to make an audience laugh. It turns into a mess and the sound becomes more disturbing than funny. The director Selcuk Aydemir did disappoint me knowing that he made the series \u0130sler Gucler, a great piece of work. See?

    "review": "At the beginning of this film onscreen text informs you that John Hull went blind in the 80s and subsequently kept an audio diary. Those original recordings are now used in the film and the actors lip sync to them... It's a beautiful idea and instantly grabs you in this really personal and at times heartbreaking story. Ultimately though, this is expertly crafted and awe-inspiring. It's a theological study as much as a practical one, but John's resolve really leaves you wondering how you'd cope yourself, if you could be as strong. Going blind is a scary thought, but John Hull proves without doubt it need not be.",

    "review": "Okay, is Frat Star a plot-driven modern masterpiece of cinema? Not by most standards. However, the movie has far too many hilarious scenes and quotable lines to discard as a downright bad movie. The acting for every single supporting character was phenomenal without fail. Nick Cooper could've been a better protagonist with a better actor but all in all, the pervasive comedy of the movie was great. The film had its failings with attempts at drama but even then the drama had its comedic value at being so awkward. I would go so far as to say Frat Star is absolutely a must watch and many of the critic and user reviews of the movie take it too seriously. The movie doesn't necessarily push an intense underlying social commentary but it is a hilarious spoof on Greek life. The only aspect of the movie that leaves you utterly disappointed is the very ending but that doesn't take away from the sheer number of quotable one-liners and outrageous comedy scenes.",

    "review": "Love Christmas/Christmas-themed films and have an appreciation for horror with shades of thriller. So despite hearing a lot of negativity, 'Red Christmas' premise did really intrigue. Plus the cover was an attention-grabbing one. Really wanted to like it and for it to not be another waste of decent potential. Watching it, unfortunately 'Red Christmas' turned out to be exactly that...a waste of decent potential. Not how to execute such an intriguing idea. It's not irredeemably awful by any stretch, there are a couple of good things. Those good things are sadly eclipsed by the numerous things 'Red Christmas' gets catastrophically wrong. Killer is the completely wrong way to describe it, the Christmas theme didn't seem relevant and was bland, the more serious elements (i.e. abortion) the film tried to include were diluted and the horror elements were predictable, not scary and too tame. Lets get the good things out of the way first. The best thing about 'Red Christmas' is the villain's look, it is great. So cool and menacing, not goofy at all.Dee Wallace brings heart, class and dignity to the film, something that was so lacking elsewhere that her presence was in a different league to everything else and put them to shame, she deserved a much better film.Generally the acting ranges from very bad to truly terrible, Wallace excepted. Their cringe-worthy, unintentionally silly dialogue (one deserves a prize if they succeed in not bursting out laughing when they're not meant to, that is a challenge), annoying characters with stupid and illogical decision-making and behaviours and indifferent direction gave them no favours. Neither did the story, where there is no warmth, cosiness, charm or magic to the Christmas theme (the Christmas spirit just isn't there). The more serious elements didn't feel like they belong and felt trivialised and cloying, when reading about the film initially admired that the film was including mature and sensitive subjects but it does nothing with them. There is no tension or suspense here, no surprises, no creativity, no wit and the only thing that is scary is the look of the villain and the scare factor ends there. The kills are un-creative, instead of biting the nails one is shrugging their shoulders, and the whole horror atmosphere feels tame and leans towards being dumb.'Red Christmas' is an eyesore visually. With the lighting, colour schemes and camera work, it seemed to striving for the showing off or experimenting with supposedly arty to them feel but instead it comes off amateurish and nauseating. Cannot remember the music.Overall, not irredeemable but very bad. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

    "review": "While Hong Kong may not be well known for its sports development, many people may not know the existence of The Shatin Martins, Hong Kong's first government baseball team. First time director Chan Chi Fat brings the story of The Shatin Martins onto the big screen, where Weeds on Fire answer the question: Who are the Shatin Martins?The story is told from the perspective of Lung (Lam Yiu-Seng), a teenager growing up in Shatin during 1984. Coming from a neighborhood high school well-known for its poor disciplinary control, the students are enthusiastic in sports. The school principal, Mr Lo (Liu Kai-Chi), decided to turn a bunch of students with poor disciplinary records into Hong Kong's baseball team pioneers. Lung and his classmates were recruited by Mr Lo, where the boys undergo harsh training from the iron fist of Mr Lo. The harsh training builds up strong discipline among the boys, which not only makes the team enter the final round in the baseball tournament, but also creating an unknown glory in the sports history of Hong Kong. The movie is not just a bunch of rowdy underdogs into a champion with remarkable results. Rather, it covers a wider aspect of a teenager in his growing up years: facing the dilemma of breaking undesired truth to his best friend, crush with a girl he loves, discovering his mother's infidelity and taking care of his aging father. While this doesn't seem to have any relationship to the theme of the film, it helps the audience to understand the struggle any typical youth will undergo while juggling with training and tournaments. Apart from showcasing the tough training the boys undergo, it also carries an important message: giving up equals to losing. The message Mr Lo wants to instill on the boys are more than just winning the competition. It is also about developing their inner characters to prepare them from the reality the moment the boys join the working society. This can be seen from the opening and closing scene, where we see an adult Lung walking on the streets of Central occupied with protesters during the Yellow Umbrella Movement in 2014. Weeds on Fire is one of the few Hong Kong independent productions which deserves its limelight, considered that this is a lesser known indie productions which fails to get the publicity it deserves. Watch this if you are a sports lover and you have never really came across a really good baseball movie after Penny Marshall's A League of Their Own (1992).",

He discovers from flashbacks, gang members sent to kill him, and an incredible set of skills, that he is a former assassin/hit-man for the crime boss, Lee. When Ailin (the nurse who looked after Ishmael for two months and has liking to) is kidnapped by Lee, Ishmael sets on a mission to save Ailin, and to confront Lee once and for all. \"Headshot\" was the last film I saw at the 52nd Chicago International Film Festival this year and it was a very action packed way to leave the festival till next year.\"Headshot\" is directed by Timo Tjahjanto, and Kimo Stamboel who also directed the very successful \"Killers\" (2014). The two directors have an excellent direction when it comes down to choreographing the stunts and fights and always do it with such flare. The cinematography is very well done, not to compare to \"The Raid\" films but the camera is much more shakier in \"Headshot\" and not as smooth and fluid as \"The Raid\" films, but nevertheless I can see what's going on and it overall captures the action very well.The acting is overall very well. For an action film of this caliber you don't really need stellar performances but rather great action and stunt work which Iko Uwais is very good at due to him being the star for both \"The Raid\" films. I had a blast with this film, it was just exactly what I expected it to be, amazing action, average plot, and bad-ass characters. The audience that I saw the film with were super into it, there was always an \"oh s***.\" or \"whooo!\" whenever a fight scene was happening or when it ended. It was awesome. Other than the film being action packed and violently entertaining there's nothing else to it. This film is 100% pure entertainment, that's what it set out to be and that's what it will always be. I will admit the violence in the film was very overwhelming, every 5 or so minutes you had someone get shot in the ear, have their arm snapped in half, or burning alive. And much like \"The Raid\" films the absurdity and unbelievability of the violence is UNBELIEVABLE, and I love it. I mean where else will you see a guy who has his arm and leg broken with nails embedded in his fist and half beaten to a pulp still able to keep on fighting. I was laughing out loud to this stuff because it's so damn silly but so damn entertaining.\"Headshot\" is nothing but a pure energetic and adrenaline filled film full of violence to satisfy any die hard action cinephile out there.

The prequel wasn't bad but the direction and action were pretty sloppy done by Nishikant Kamat and Ayananka Bose. This movie was a bit better than the prequel but with nothing to tell.John Abraham has good abs but can't act. His rough humor and acting turns out to be a snooze fest but his acting was bearable during the action scenes and that's basically it.Sonakshi Sinha was okay in some parts. At least she is doing some sensible roles just like Akira because I am tired of seeing her waiting for Chulbul Pandey cutting vegetables.Tahir Raj Bhasin was great as a villain. I believe he brought some good mentality from Mardaani in which he also performed well.The story and screenplay was the biggest downfall in this movie. It is almost like Jason Bourne-Mad Max combo but with no script. The direction was okay in some parts usually when it came to action sequences but the editing was a bit too problematic in such when they were doing aerial shots but the editing of the action sequences were good and crisp. The music was a disappointment except Rang Laal where JA kills it with his voice and rap. Abhinay Deo managed to give good action just like the car chasing, building chasing, shooting, and etc. The cinematography was also pretty good especially when they roped in Imre Juhasz who was a DOP for Die Hard.This movie also presented RAW in a very bad way in such of missions and etc. Narendra Jha was quite bad as a Raw senior and he was over the top.I felt Genelia wasn't needed but since it was sequel, I was okay with it but her role kinda stretched the movie to a small extent which took up a bit of the time especially when there was a song dedicated to it.Overall this movie was okay in terms of Action and Tahir's acting but the partial mediocre direction and screenplay bought the film down which is why Force 2 is definitely worth watching but on a TV Broadcast or a Netflix. 2/5- action improved but story needs to be improved",

The film provides enough materials to engage the audience. it is less dramatic and point to the object of the film. less dramatic means mostly Indian movies are melodramatic and here you won't find it much. story line and face of the story done well. ensemble cast shows good performance. up to climax film fares well but personally the climax is bit average. nevertheless finishing is and providing viewer a satisfaction. I guarantee you won't be disappointed with the movie and enjoyable to the last even you are Tamil film lover. so I say go for it.",

They spend the night talking of dreams, the chances they may take and horsing around just this side of being overtly homoerotic.The air is crackling with sexual tension and then the story moves on into the future and that is where it gets very interesting and quite deep. To say more would ruin the plot. Now this is essentially a play in three acts and it could easily be staged. The cast is minimal and that means that everyone has to be on top form and they all are. Tovey has to carry most scenes but he is ably supported by the others involved.This is a gay based film but it is not a bedroom fest but does feature a fair bit of nakedness but not the Full Monty type either. This is a film for those who like a very human story and have an interest in why so few football professional players have ever come out of the very packed footie closet.",

    "review": "Mean Dreams is every adolescent's worst nightmare. Or maybe it's horrible scenarios like this that prepare youngsters for the real world, and build character. Or perhaps they just turn them into the same bitter, violent adults they're trying to escape from, only to perpetuate the circle. In any case, it's an ugly, somber story, scarred by the harsh realities some teens face on the road to adulthood. It's ironic in a way that this is Bill Paxton's last role in cinema, and I wish it weren't, because he plays an absolute monster. For anyone who's met him or seen interviews, he was the sweetest dude you could ever hope to meet, and wouldn't hurt a fly, but he always chose tough scripts that made memorable, challenging films and this is just one more. Here he plays a lawman and single father who moves his daughter (Sophie Nelisse) out to a desolate county, brought to life by stunning, haunted rural Ontario. Once there, she finds her only friend in a local rancher's son (Josh Wiggins), and it's not long before romance begins to flourish. Not on Paxton's watch though, that angry drunk prick. Abusive, dangerous and up to his neck in illegal activities, it's only a matter of time before he gets one of them, himself, or everyone killed, and Wiggins hatches a plan to get the both of them out of there and on the run to better lives. Trouble is, where do you turn for help in a town whose only police officers are not there to help you? Paxton has a bitter ally in the Police Chief, venomously played by Colm Feore, and the dragnet they lay over the county threatens to ensnare the two teens at every turn. Wiggins and Nelisse are excellent, especially for their age, playing the character development with all the right notes, even when things get tense between the two of them, a facet of their relationship that's nice to see and brings out shades of maturity in the writing, touches that this type of film begs for. Paxton is scary, tragic, broken and brutal, a soured man who shows occasional flickers of the father he once must have been, and despite the ugliness, it's some of his best work in a while, particularly during a positively poetic final confrontation. The cinematography from Steve Cosens lingers in the long grass until you can hear the mournful echoes of a region beset by economic despair, a place where danger breeds easily and is always just on the horizon, an uneasy mood also perpetuated by Son Lux's unconventional score, which finds the spark of first love amidst the strife. Downbeat, but hopeful stuff.",

    "review": "Greetings again from the darkness. Maybe the line between megalomania and genius doesn't exist, or a more likely explanation has the two as mutually exclusive. Director Lydia Tenaglia (an Emmy winner) tackles the profile of ultra-fascinating Jeremiah Tower, one of, if not the first U.S. celebrity chef. Her approach seems to carom between idol worship, psychoanalysis and mythology, often creating a rudderless feeling for viewers \u2013 viewers who remain captivated by the man and the story.Mr. Tower performs voice-over during much of the segment on his childhood, and one of his first lines, \"I have to stay away from human beings because somehow I'm not one\", sets the stage for a childhood that explains much. His wealthy parents took a hands-off approach, though young Jeremiah (when not in elite boarding school) often accompanied them on international travels, luxurious Ocean cruises (including the Queen Mary), and first class resorts and hotels. The solitude of these trips invariably found the young boy in the kitchen with food, his favorite travel companion. An evening on a beach with a stranger who is grilling a barracuda provides a particularly harrowing memory, and clearly helps us understand how that 6 year old grew to be an adult who never found a humanistic rhythm with others.Anthony Bourdain is a producer on the film and also provides commentary throughout. He states \"We should know who changed the world\". Specifically he is referring to the pioneers of food, and he puts Jeremiah Tower as high on the pedestal as any. Bourdain, other chefs, Tower's Harvard friends, and even food critics chime in on the impact of Tower joining Alice Waters at her Berkeley Chez Panisse in 1972. The idealism of the times and the people created a cultural clash that resulted in what Martha Stewart termed New American cuisine, or perhaps more accurately, California cuisine. Some terrific photos and clips of those early days really add an element of depth to an era which is typically lacking in such documentation.After the split between Ms. Waters and Mr. Tower, his explosion into the global food world occurred with his Stars restaurant in San Francisco in the mid-1980's. This seemed to be the meld of Tower's personality, his creative menu ideas, and his quest for the perfect eating establishment, and soon became known worldwide as a must-visit for traveling foodies.It's at this point where the timeline becomes muddled \u2013 seemingly on purpose by the filmmaker - in an effort to add mystery to what otherwise would be expected erratic behavior from an artist who just can't be satisfied. Tower's self-imposed exile leaves his friends befuddled, and we get interspersed shots of him climbing pyramids and cooking in his Merida apartment. Philosophical meanderings are used to fill the gaps. \"What are my great expectations?\" How could such a genius be expected to live with \"the horror of mediocrity\"? On more than one occasion, we hear Tower's life philosophy stated as \"I long for the crown, but know the guillotine is close\". This would all seem overly dramatic if it didn't so perfectly fit the profile of the man.The incomprehensible \"comeback\" at NYC's Tavern on the Green after 15 years away, does allow us to more closely view his endless pursuit of perfection, and the price paid for a life of loneliness and ego. True innovators and true genius are often painful to look at once the curtain is pulled back.",

And I have to admit that when I sat down to watch this 2021 Netflix comedy drama then I was expecting it to be another archetypical McCarthy comedy.I am glad that I opted to sit down and watch \"The Starling\", from writer Matt Harris and director Theodore Melfi, because this movie was enjoyable. Not only was it an enjoyable movie to watch, but it also had a very well-written and beautiful storyline. And the movie also showcase that Melissa McCarthy is more than just your average comedian, because she really puts on a strong and memorable performance in this movie.The storyline told in \"The Starling\" wasn't really a comedy as per se. Sure, there were some pseudo-funny moments here and there, but the movie had its focus on the drama aspect of the story, and that panned out quite well, especially since it was a rather emotional and well-written storyline.\"The Starling\" has a great cast ensemble with some rather impressive names on the list, with the likes of Melissa McCarthy - obviously. But also with the likes of Kevin Kline, Timothy Olyphant, Chris O'Dowd, Rosalind Chao and Loretta Devine.I was genuinely entertained by \"The Starling\", and it is a movie that I will recommend you to sit down and watch. If you haven't already seen \"The Starling\", and if you get the chance to do so, you should, because this is a rather good movie and a nice chance of pace from Melissa McCarthy.My rating of \"The Starling\" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",

It was written and directed by Sarah Adina Smith, and it stars Rami Malek (in his first starring film role), Toby Huss, Kate Lyn Sheil and DJ Qualls. The movie had it's world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, and it's received mostly positive reviews from critics. I found it to be bizarrely interesting, and for the most part pretty well made, but it also left things just a little too unexplained for my tastes.The film opens with a mountain man, Buster (Malek), desperately trying to escape the authorities that are chasing him. He makes it to the top of a mountain, where the film then flashes back to his past as a family man, with a wife (Sheil) and daughter (Sukha Belle Potter). He also recollects on his time breaking into empty vacation homes, and calling into radio shows ranting about an upcoming 'Inversion' (at the turn of the millennium). Buster also has multiple visions of being lost at sea. As a viewer we have to interpret what's real, what isn't, and when and where it's all taking place.The film is definitely bizarre and interesting, and I was always curious of where it was leading to. I think the acting is good in the film (especially Malek in the lead) and Smith is obviously a very talented filmmaker. I was just hoping for a little more from the conclusion. I don't need everything explained to me in a film, but I don't like everything to be left a question mark either. I'm sure some viewers will think they understand it, but I think most of the film is entirely left up to individual interpretation.

Without prior knowledge of the series, I may have required multiple views to understand the timeline and events. It has a similar feel to the stories, though, and I enjoyed it.Season 2 had a great first episode and an okay finale, but meandered in the middle episodes. The substance of many adapted stories were altered. Parts that were main story in the book felt like filler and lacked necessary plot & character development. I'll never understand why adaptations leave out parts that are important to understanding the main plot and characters, yet add meaningless fluff & soap opera drama. Some characters that don't say ten words in the books are main POV characters now.Season 3 was awful. Before even looking at the train wreck of the content, I wonder why NF released half the season, when the second half will be aired three weeks? Why not wait and release the entire series, or release one episode each week? Anyway, regardless of the stupid release schedule, the first half of season 3 is abysmal. The main actors who brought the characters to life in season 1 don't seem to want to be there at all anymore. The script writers are no longer even trying to follow the Witcher stories, they're just off in the weeds doing their own thing. The drop in quality this season is precipitous.

First, you have to trust all the good reviews in the world and start watching. Second, you will enjoy this show starting from the first episode. Third, nobody will tell you to continue watching further, but you will anyway. Then after finishing this show, you thank your friend. Or should I say you will thank yourself because you chose to finish this show? Doesn't really matter.I find at least 3 reasons why people are doubting this show.First. \"Isn't this show just like any other friendships movie/series?\". Short answer, it's NOT. Don't get me wrong, any kind of good friendships film will definitely warm your heart, I always love friendships films. However, there are too many other treasures to talk about that you can find in this show. Role of moms, dads, admirers, crushes, dreams, siblings, fate, boys gang, girls gang, exes, education, morals, marriages. And why are they even important? Because you will then REALLY understand to be in other people's shoes.Second. \"There are not much going on in 1988, is this even relevant? Isn't this extremely boring?\". Well, definitely you won't find any fancy things here. No fancy fiction things just like any other korean dramas, no major plot twist or whatsoever. My question is, why is that even a problem? Really you don't have to worry all of those questions. The show will still feel very close to us that you really want to be one of the characters. Unfortunately, rewatching the show again and again will be the only way you can make your dream come true.Third. \"I can guess the plot. There is one girl in those friendships, so it will just be triangle or rectangle love story, just like any others.\" Again. Please do yourself a favor not to worry these things. There are sooo many things that you can talk about rather than worrying if there is good romance aspects or not.Last thing I want to remind you because you have arrived to this review.\nPLEASE.

Of course, the prey has slim chances to survive as per the initial setup of the hunting \"game\", yet it takes some time for the villagers to learn that the prey this time does not give in so easily as in previous years. In a series of scenes, switching from prey to prey, one falling after the other, yet this time with victims on both sides. Luckily for us viewers, it all went differently from previous years. Alcohol plays an important side role, primarily (of course) for main character Warren throughout the running time, but he also makes productive use of alcohol near the finale.Entertaining throughout, apart from Warren's alcohol addiction and related cold turkey phenomena, and despite the unnecessary violence, the latter not shown in all gory detail yet suggested with not much left to outguess. For example, when someone's head is beaten with a baseball bat, the movement of the bat is clearly shown but not the ultimate effects on the receiving end. A concession towards content advisory ratings?? It won't help, as the whole movie is riddled with unmitigated violence all over. But it is not Horror in the old-fashioned and literal sense of the word, so no dark corners nor ancient buildings, no monsters nor ghosts, only ordinary (yet redneck) people operating in broad daylight (or some at night) with destructive intentions.All in all, casting and acting make this movie stand out in the first place, in addition to the original plot with many unexpected developments.",

Bryan Cranston has to carry the majority of the film as we see everything through his eyes or as he interprets it. It is a unique way to show a person as they go through a possible break down. Who among us hasn't wanted to walk away from our life at some point? And haven't we wondered if we'd be missed and by whom? A must see film!",

The direction and story line were decent. Unlike Bin Roye, the movie had great flow between scenes and looked appropriately edited. The songs were unique and the theme well played out. The three main actors, Adeel Hussain, Mahira Khan, and Shehreyar Munawwar acted extremely well, so much that some scenes became real tear-jerkers, however some of the older and more mature actors did not act with such finesse.Ho Mann Jahan was a great attempt by Pakistani cinema and is definitely a must-watch. Although some aspects of movie-making are still lacking and there is always room for improvement, Pakistani cinema has definitely taken a huge step forward with this movie.",

I don't dislike the opinions, but most are uninformed and there are some scientific errors here and there.Still I give it a positive review, as it can achieve its goal into showing people what our mindless action can do to the environment and, in the midle/long term, to us!

On appeal, the film was re-rated to 16+.",
    "review": "Quiet, precise and profoundly critical, Aquarius is a sharp depiction of an ever changing, ever adapting Brazilian society, increasingly subject to a disproportionate capitalism that is bulldozing over identity, history and sentiment. Split into three chapters - one of them construed as a prologue - there would not be a better way of introducing who this(ese) character(s) is(are) and setting up what their nature is, what motivates them and what kind of culture, family values and roots they hold throughout. Led by a powerful and heartfelt performance by S\u00f3nia Braga that single-handedly carries the film, meticulously embodying all of the character's traits in her continuous struggles with motherhood, disease, change and most importantly time lapse. Her artistic preferences and passions show how a deeply and typically traditional society can still honor and maintain their culture while not being averse to technology, change and evolution. At the end of the day, Aquarius is an elegant tale of how opinions and values change with time and how easily the current generation might be bent and influenced by money and greed and how that greed can easily stampede over traditionalism.

Congratulations A Flying Jatt, you've managed to fall even below that. I get the fact that this movie had a noble message persuading people to save our planet but still, where's the moral support in this movie. Prabhu Deva and Farah Khan- choreographers in which they have disrespected themselves as film directors. Although Farah Khan made Main Hoon Na and Om Shanti Om but after TMK, things got worse. Remo D' Souza is finally in the same category. ABCD was a good film. But for this one, the direction and editing for this film was the main reason why I felt like throwing my shoe towards the screen. The VFX looked like the Govinda version of Superman from one of his 90s movies. The superhero scenes were choreographed very poorly and the characterization was very cringed up. The costume looked like Akshay Kumar when he became King in Singh Is Kingg. Tiger Shroff should leave the acting sector of the film industry. I mean technically his dance movies are a killer and his action stunts are phenomenal but he just can't act. Jacqueline Fernandez was like a kid in this movie I mean she had very kiddish instincts in the movie and she just couldn't leave the comfort zone. Kay Kay Menon was alright during 1st half but ending it just had to be a drag. Nathan Jones who played the villain Raka was like Sunny Deol in Ghayal because throughout the movie, he just shouts which was annoying. The songs were't that great except for Beat pe Booty which had good dancing sequences between Tiger and Jackie. Overall, this movie just failed to entertain and its completely pointless and cringe worthy. Don't spend your money on this atrocious piece of art and just use it to take your friends out for coffee, Focus on Hollywood if you like superhero movies.

    "review": "\"Brahman Naman\" is a coming-of-age comedy directed by Qaushiq Mukherjee, commonly known as Q. Released in 2016, the film presents a refreshing take on teenage angst, sexuality, and cultural identity set against the backdrop of a quizzing competition in 1980s India.Plot and Execution:The film follows the misadventures of Naman, a socially awkward, brilliant quizzing champion played by Shashank Arora, and his two friends, Ajay (Tanmay Dhanania) and Ramu (Chaitanya Varad). Together, they navigate the complexities of adolescence, raging hormones, and their quest to win the all-India quiz championship.Strengths:Humor and Satire:\"Brahman Naman\" excels in its sharp wit and irreverent humor. Q's direction infuses the narrative with biting satire and comic situations, offering a humorous yet poignant exploration of teenage insecurities and desires.Cultural Commentary:The film provides a candid commentary on the societal norms and conservative attitudes prevalent in 1980s India, particularly concerning sex and relationships. It juxtaposes the characters' academic prowess with their awkwardness in social interactions, highlighting the clash between tradition and modernity.Character Dynamics:The chemistry among the central trio-Naman, Ajay, and Ramu-is palpable and drives much of the film's narrative charm. Their banter, camaraderie, and individual quirks add depth to their characters, making them relatable and endearing to the audience.Period Aesthetics:Q's attention to detail in recreating the 1980s era is commendable. The film captures the nostalgia of that time through its costumes, music, and cultural references, enhancing the authenticity of the setting and adding to the film's nostalgic appeal.Weaknesses:Pacing and Narrative Focus:\nWhile the film is rich in humor and character-driven moments, some viewers may find the pacing uneven, especially in the second half. Certain subplots could have been further developed to maintain narrative momentum and coherence.Conclusion:\"Brahman Naman\" is a delightful coming-of-age comedy that cleverly blends humor, satire, and cultural commentary. Qaushiq Mukherjee's direction, coupled with strong performances from the cast, delivers a film that not only entertains but also offers insightful reflections on youth, identity, and societal expectations.The film's irreverent humor and sharp wit make it a standout in the genre of Indian indie cinema. It challenges conventions while celebrating the awkwardness and complexities of adolescence, ultimately resonating with audiences who appreciate its candid portrayal of teenage life in a rapidly changing society.Overall, \"Brahman Naman\" is a must-watch for its unique storytelling, memorable characters, and its ability to capture the essence of youthful rebellion and self-discovery. It remains a testament to Q's distinctive filmmaking style and his knack for blending humor with social critique, making it a rewarding cinematic experience.",

Also, this would not explain a sudden volcanic eruption and probably not explain a tsunami-like tide.",

    "review": "The movie Step Sisters on Netflix is a masterpiece of terrible cinema.The film tells the story of a black girl teaching a white sorority how to dance like black girls. It manages to mash together every bad trope from the 'Dance competition' movies from the early 2000's(think Bring It On) with cringingly terrible acting, a ridiculous plot, excellent dancing, and unintentionally hilarious quotability(\"YOU NEED TO MAKE THEIR ASS HAIR STAND UP!!!\").This is all served alongside a large helping of performative 'wokeness', uncomfortable, non-funny racial humor and unfocused social justice 'lessons'. ( For instance, a large part of the plot is about the impact of cultural appropriation of black traditions by white people, but then also features a dance number with a bunch of black women dressed as generic Asian women in silk robes and fans without blinking an eye.)Please note I am making no comment on actual cultural appropriation, race, or social justice. The movie tries to make these issues a major plot point, and fails spectacularly. The only major lesson the movie ends up conveying is \"Race, culture, and upbringing are unimportant as long as you are rich and pretty'I HIGHLY recommend it, if only as a unintended parody of the current 'everything is offensive to the point where we cant tell what is actually offensive\" climate, but also as a gem of cinematic garbage that at times approaches The Room in terms of terribleness and watchability",

    "review": "Hong Kong powerhouses Derek Yee and Tsui Hark team up to bring this lavish, beautifully made production to the fans. A loose remake of 1977's fantastic Death Duel which starred Derek Yee in the lead role - both of which are a take on the novel by Gu Long, this update was made for the 3D market although still highly impresses when watched as normal.While a little confusing in the long-run, of which I put down to its main leads Kenny Lin and Peter Ho looking too much alike as well as its interconnecting flashbacks, the film does entertain enough to keep you watching - finally ironing itself out in the later half.With incredible sets and locations (some of which are CGI enhanced), beautiful costumes and non-stop swordplay/wire-fu action, Swordmaster is a stunningly polished version of films such as Zu Warriors; Swordsman 2; Moon Warriors; Bride With White Hair and many more - and to me, falls very easily alongside those classics as one of the best in its genre.Kenny Lin (Taking of Tiger Mountain; The Great Wall) strangely enough reminds me of Kenny Ho (Red Wolf; Project A 2) and impresses as the lead of the film, hiding in a brothel and neighbouring village as Useless Chi, avoiding the troubles and nightmares that plague him from his earlier days with his father and cult leader Hsieh, played by the wonderful Norman Tsui Siu Keung.Peter Ho as the tattooed face assassin Yen Shi San is just brilliant, with his opening scene on the snowy bridge setting the pace for the rest of the film and taking part in the most of the films major action scenes wonderfully choreographed by the fantastic Yuen Bun and Dion Lam.With plenty of great characters and performances, there is hardly a slow moment throughout the whole film, with every shot beautifully framed and captured, it just keeps your eyes glued to the screen for its full running time. Swordmaster may suffer from a few minor CG flaws as well as the aforementioned story telling at the beginning, but its a damn near perfect wu xia film and one I have enjoyed re-watching time and time again...Overall: A stunningly action-packed revisit to HK's golden years in style, Swordsman is highly recommended!",

    "plot": "In the segment \"Season of the End\", the sample collection date in English (Sept 8) is different from Chinese (Aug 8).",
    "review": "Made in 2015, 'Ten Years' is a collection of stand-alone stories from different directors that speculate what Hong Kong might be like one decade hence. As such it is surprising the self-imposed authorities in Beijing allowed the film to be made, let alone screened, as most of the stories take a dim view of the Chinese Communist Party's stewardship of the former British territory.Four of the five stories are interesting and enjoyable, so let's get the dross out of the way first: 'Season of the End', in which a dreary young couple collect specimens of smashed pottery, ash and the like in order to preserve them. Whether this refers to a fad in current-day Hong Kong I do not know, but there seems little purpose to the film, which meanders all over the place, including some ramblings about a holiday the pair took in New Zealand. Perhaps that is the last time they were happy; after sitting through this story, I know how they feel! It is interesting that the least political of the stories is the dullest.Okay, on to the good stuff: In 'Local Egg' a shopkeeper wonders from where he will source his eggs following the closure of Hong Kong's last poultry farm, and also has to contend with his son's membership of a young communist group that reports deviations from approved labelling in shops. The prospect of children being used to inform on their elders is chilling but all too believable, and the actor playing the everyman grocer gives a nice performance of a man frustrated by petty regulations.Another nice everyman performance comes from the lead actor in 'Dialect', in which a taxi driver finds his business shrinking because he does not speak well enough the officially-sanctioned Mandarin (Hong Kong's traditional language being Cantonese). This is another example of the Beijing authorities seeking to stamp out local distinctiveness (for an extreme example today, see Tibet). It is enjoyable, but for the viewer who speaks neither Cantonese nor Mandarin and is relying instead on the English sub-titles the full impact was probably lost.'Extras' follows a plot by members of the Hong Kong elite to pave the way for Beijing to introduce a (presumably restrictive) national security law. Their plan is to shoot one of two politicians appearing at a neighbourhood rally. While discussions continue as to which politician to attack, the ethnic-Indian gangster charged with carrying it out tries to convince himself it will be a success. Shot in black-and-white, this is a suspenseful work.'Extras' is very enjoyable, but it is beaten by a whisker as the best contribution by 'Self-Immolator', which seeks to assign responsibility for its former territory to the United Kingdom. As the story begins, we see the smoking remains of someone who has set themselves alight outside the British Consulate-General as part of a campaign to force the UK to challenge the Chinese authorities' behaviour. Using a mixture of straight drama and mock interviews, the film then goes back in time a few days, following the lives of various characters (including another ethnic Indian, this time a female student) one of whom, we are led to believe, is the suicide. There's a heart-breaking twist to this tale.Overall this collection is politically rather one-sided: the only real acknowledgement that some Hong Kongers support Chinese control of the territory is in 'Extras', and I assume a bunch of people plotting assassination are hardly representative of most citizens of HK! But as long as the viewer accepts that (completely understandable) bias, this is - 'Season of the End' aside - a terrific collection of stories.",

    "review": "This retelling of the death of young Kennedy entourage \"Boiler Room\" secretary Mary Jo Kopechne and the involvement therein (or lack of same, arguably) of rising US senator and last surviving brother of the Kennedy family dynasty, Edward Kennedy, holds back little as it nails its accusatory colours to the mast.I re-read as much background as I could on the tragic incident and it's difficult not to come to the same conclusion as the writer and director of this movie, that Kennedy firstly failed to attempt to rescue the stricken girl immediately after he escaped the sinking car, then got two of his slavishly obedient underlings to repeatedly dive into the river to try to save the girl, didn't report the matter immediately to the authorities where we learn that if he had, Mary Jo might even have made it out alive, before most shamefully of all, he played down and indeed lied about his role in the matter to go along with the abhorrent advice of the supporting Kennedy machine, a phalanx of important Democrats, including former Secretary of State Robert MacNamara, to cover up his part and so keep alive his future eligibility for the presidency. As usual in dramatisations of real life happenings, some dramatic licence appears to be taken with events. For example was Ted Kennedy really so scared of his elderly, paralysed father, the family patriarch Joseph (played by an unrecognisable Bruce Dern) and so ashamed of himself as the underperforming last son of the family to justify acting in this deplorable spineless way? Then, was there anything sexual between Kennedy and Kopechne on the night - there are cryptic but inconclusive flashbacks shown hinting at something and Kennedy, whose wife hadn't made the trip, was a known womaniser. Did he really contemplate resigning the Senate right up to the last minute before caving into the surrounding peer pressure and instead turn his live TV broadcast into the contemptible self-serving speech it turned out to be, including his horrendous assertion that this was the infamous \"Kennedy Curse\" working on him - this just in Senator Kennedy, you didn't die, Miss Kopechne did - and in so saying, trying to bathe in the reflected glory of his two slain brothers? I also thought it was a major mistake to fail to mention the substantial payment that was made to the dead girl's parents, presumably to hush them up.Only one person knows what happened on that fateful night and I concur with the film-makers' assertion here that Kennedy not only acted in a selfish, cowardly way at the scene - he even tried to weasel out of this by faking a medical report that he was concussed in the crash which affected his actions and then compounded the felony by \"wearing\" a neck brace for effect at the funeral.This as I said is a brave film, justifiably, I believe, taking a side and having the courage of its convictions to stick to it. Jason Clarke is excellent as Kennedy while the rest of the lesser known cast give him credible support. The direction could have done with less of the voguish drone shots which seemed at odds with the realistic approach adopted elsewhere plus I found the soundtrack dull and again lacking affinity with the era portrayed.I doubt this film will gain wide distribution but hope it does. It's an excellent drama, the tragedy of which is how realistically it depicted a tragically avoidable real life accident.",

I have read some people complain about the weakness of this film as a 'documentary', with comments about how key players such as Mark Zuckerberg and others are not included; the answer to such criticism is in the title, because this is not a documentary so much as it is a reverie, which is to say a musing and free-floating daydream through the subject.In the editing suite this was obviously reined in somewhat because the film is structured into broad chapters. This helps the film be watchable, but importantly does not lose the sense of drifting through the subject with plenty to think about but nothing too solid that would break the state of reverie. Whether or not this works for you will depend on the individual, but Herzog's style made it work for me because he drives this approach with his angles and his line of thought (although he often seems less present than in some other of his films). It doesn't all fit together neatly of course, and at times tonally it is uneven, but mostly it is a quite fascinating wander through the ideas and connections of the internet, and is well worth seeing for what it leaves you with as much as what it offers directly.",

    "review": "Norman Lear can honestly claim to have made the U.S. a better place, both apart from and through his work as a TV producer and writer. Directors Grady and Ewing have put together a creditable biographical documentary that serves as a solid introduction to the man, an overview of his work, and the influence he's had on U.S. culture.Though there are excerpts from some of his most famous shows -- from \"All in the Family\" through \"Maude,\" \"Good Times,\" \"The Jeffersons,\" and \"Fernwood 2 Night\" (though no mention of \"Sanford and Son,\" curiously) -- as well as recent comments and archival interview footage from some of the actors (a clip of Carroll O'Connor on a talk show correcting a description of his character as a \"lovable bigot\" by focusing on the essential unhappiness of the man is especially memorable), the emphasis is on Lear's life as a man and as an entertainment professional.We learn about the effects of his father's conviction and imprisonment for selling fake bonds when Norman was 9, the Second World War (in which Lear served as a radio operator on a B-17 bomber), the influence of his second wife Frances in pushing for women's rights, how his overwork and the collapse of that marriage led to Lear stepping away from TV production and founding the nonprofit People for the American Way to battle the so-called Moral Majority. There's a third marriage, more children, some home video footage of the family in recent decades.The filmmakers expend a fair amount of footage on a sound stage, showing a (presumably) 9-year-old version of Lear being affected by Father Coughlan's racist radio speeches and other events in the real man's life. (An earlier IMDb reviewer has referred to Lear purchasing a copy of the Constitution, but it was the Declaration of Independence.) Archival footage of Jerry Falwell and other televangelists of that era will make one both grateful they're gone and apprehensive about recent counterparts. Just being alive, kicking, and alert as Lear is at 93 is cause for celebration.Whether you were a fan of his shows or not, this documentary will certainly arouse memories of the times, and the undeniable effect that Lear's work had upon them.",

    "review": "This film is OK in the sense that it offers a look into the lives of less-than-fortunate teens, however it is not at all structured like a documentary, at least from my point of view. It feels to me like it is less of a documentary, and more like a film that just wants to make you feel either depressed or superior to these teens who cannot make ends meet. I watched this film because it was assigned for a school project, which seemed to have been structured in a way that is optimized for a regular documentary, which means that this is really not good for such a project. This film is composed of sections of students either conversing with the school principal(who I find insufferable), talking to the camera about their problems, and some scenes of the school faculty discussing issues with some of the students.There is no narration other than the voices of the teens overlayed over other scenes, and so it is pretty hard to tell what is going on in a significant part of the film. For a while I thought Ms. Viland(The principal) was some sort of social worker rather than an administrator, since it was never stated.So yeah, there are some pretty significant issues with the structure of this film, and I'm not likely to watch it again. Ever.",

    "review": "In some ways the most horrifying aspects of this film are not the details of what happened but the aftermath. In the case of Daisy Coleman, the community and local law enforcement colluded to shield the young men and shame and exclude the Coleman family. The Sheriff all but stated the two girls were somehow equally responsible for what happened and that Melinda Coleman was nutty. In the case of Audrey Potts the two main participants came across as completely lacking in remorse of understanding. At one point on of the two young men involved in the Potts assault says the biggest thing he learned out of the experience was that \"girls gossip and boys are more laid back\". Most people with any empathy will want to punch both the Mayor and Sheriff in the face. Maryville Missouri looks like a pretty corrupt place. The Potts lost their daughter and the reality is assaults against young women especially when alcohol is involved happen every day.The one hopeful thing that comes out of this is that Coleman, the Potts family and others have all become advocates for others.",

    "review": "Newtown received a standing ovation at its regional premiere at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. It touches quite a few nerves in a state that it caught up in a highly divisive debate over its gun laws. Even though everyone walking into the theater saw the news coverage of December 14, 2012 Sandy Hook massacre and knows exactly what happened, the film is hypnotic, powerful and emotionally overwhelming. It is mostly presented through interviews with family members, teachers, a priest, and first responders. They all tell the tale of the tragedy that scarred their small idyllic Connecticut town. The film focuses on three families that were willing to open up and tell some of the stories of the deaths of their children and how those deaths tore their lives apart. The small details and family photos are perhaps the most devastating. The film is done with great care, skill and humanity. The killer's name is never verbalized (and only briefly displayed in some documents on the screen) and his story is not really explored. There is clearly a political agenda at work and film is clearly advocating for more gun control, but that is secondary to presenting a human portrait of the young lives were tragically cut short. Sandy Hook has become the emotional touchstone of the gun debate, because the children were so young and so innocent. The families seem to be resilient and willing to carry on and fight for better laws to save other children from meeting the same tragic fate. The film is haunting and left much of the audience trying to hold back tears. For those who are willing to ride this emotional roller-coaster, Newtown is highly recommended.",

He witnessed the Chinese cultural revolution launched by the CCP leader Mao Zedong during his tween to his early teen years. He had known fireworks as 'good thing', a part of celebrations before the revolution but revolution changes his perception. He saw gunpowder being used to make explosives to kill people. His father was a famous calligrapher. Art runs into his blood. His work includes taxidermy, large sculptures but he is known for the oil paintings that are swapped with post-immolation markings. The calligraphy explosion. Putting gun powder onto his own oil paintings and then blowing them off. High levels of smog and 16,000 dead pigs floating in Huangpu river inspired him to work on what he called The Ninth Wave named after a Russian painting by the same name about the ninth disastrous destructive tsunami wave. His passion for fireworks and his artistic virtuosity gave birth to artistic explosions such as Transient Rainbow, Elegy (biodegradable colored clouds), Remembrance (Holi like colors sprays), Consolation (colored weeping willow like shape) fireworks. But his best work ever was a Sky Ladder, a ladder shaped strand of fireworks stretching upward for more than half a kilometer in the sky. This documentary shows the passion and planning, the story and experiences, the hard work and problems and the moment of the Sky Ladder. A great watch.",

    "review": "Cat claws are joined by rock, brick, hammer, wrench, tire iron and more as a pair of self-important and toxic narcissists sink their fangs into each other. Ashley and Veronica are from opposite sides of the political spectrum yet both share an unquenchable hatred for anyone who attacks their image. Veronica (Sandra Oh) is a caustic and drunken gold digger married to a businessman making insane profits from a war in the Middle East. She encourages her son to be anything other than a useless artist. Ashley (Anne Heche) is a sadistic painter whose apocalyptic view of war tolerates no blasphemies, including and not limited to the \"false color\" blue. Her partner is a clueless snob who, like herself, rejects anything that isn't a carbon copy of her own fluctuating views. Ashley and Veronica are former college acquaintances, now in their forties, who meet at a party. Soon they enter into a bitter, knock- down and bone- crushing brawl in the stairwell. This won't be the only fight. In their all-consuming rivalry they risk losing everything. The heat of a fire consumes all the fuel and air before it dies.Catfight is fueled by dark humor and a realistic portrayal of narcissistic personality disorder. Narcissists believe that money, success and power entitles them to treat others like trash. Yet narcissists are useful to the world because they see through all its fallacies (the greatest sinners make the best preachers). Ashley and Veronica are self-absorbed, have no empathy for others and treat their assistants more like servants and machines than persons. They are too broken to reveal their wounds to others though, which is why they never truly heal.The violence in Catfight is really brutal and vastly different from other cinematic fight scenes. The female on female fighting is just one aspect that makes the fight scenes different. Other nuances include creative brawling tools and settings, compelling themes and characters, and great acting. Anne Heche and Sandra Oh are versatile, capable actors that are adept at this type of satire. Catfight's director, in the question and answer session after the film, said that Anne and Sandra had different, but equally effective, styles of preparing for the scenes. One actor was methodical in planning and preparation, and the other was energized by each passing moment. World premiere seen at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival.",

He's engaged, and things get very messy.At the same time, a crazy, beautiful artist falls for a schlubby middle-aged guy and a man constantly after women finds his sexuality is a bit more complicated than he thinks. It's a series about young people (well, young to someone my age) who don't really know who they are and are determined to make as many mistakes as possible in finding out. The series is consistently funny and wacky and the actors are excellent. Even the most unrealistic elements (like the aforementioned artist/shlub relationship) offer more internal logic than these tropes usually get.While not as beautifully crafted as Fleabag, the series is once again the work of a first-rate comedic writer. I just wish Waller-Bridge would produce series that were more than 6 episodes long. I hope she also writes a movie at some point.",

    "review": "I hate to say most, but there's a lot of biopics that are very formulaic in nature. And come to think of it, every genre deals with that issue. I can acknowledge that it's immensely hard to make a film that feels fresh and relevant at the same time. But I think the reason I tend to feel this way about biopics is because a lot of them seem to be directly aimed for the Oscar audience. And while that could be the case with Marshall, it's nothing less than a delightful film to watch.As with so many biopics, the main reason Marshall succeeds is Chadwick Boseman's unsurprisingly good turn as the famous lawyer, Thurgood Marshall. Whether or not Thurgood was this way in real life, I absolutely loved the sheer display of confidence in Boseman's portrayal. It was almost to the point of cockiness, without being arrogant. It's that balance that made me appreciate what this man brought to the table.Of course, there's also the dynamic of having a story that is still relevant to this day. Not only are people of color still discriminated, underestimated, and not believed in the court of law, but the idea of pitting race against race in the courtroom is something that is still unfortunately an issue today. So in a way, it was disheartening to watch the injustices happening throughout Marshall, as we know they are far from being over in the 1940's, but it's always nice to see something stick up for their people no matter what time period they are from.Boseman isn't the only one who gives a good performance as Josh Gad, Sterling K. Brown, Kate Hudson, James Cromwell, and a few others give valuable turns as their respected characters. I think my only issue with the film is that it ultimately felt very safe. I'm not one to know how these real life cases played out, but Marshall definitely feels like it took a guarded approach to the subject matter. Because of that, you can appeal to a mass audience, but I don't know that it was as detailed or thorough that it needed to be. Don't get me wrong, Marshall is a powerful film, but I think it could have taken an even further step forward into that realm.8.2/10",

    "review": "Set during Spanish Civil War on the tumultuous and violent 1937 in Front of Arag\u00f3n. The film is divided in various parts whose backdrop is the Spanish Civil War on the front and the rear of the Republicans . Recounting the experiences of young Lieutenant Llu\u00eds de Broc\u00e0 i de Ruscalleda (Marcel Borr\u00e0s) on the Aragon front whose lover is Trini Milmany (Bruna Cus\u00ed) , who results to be the female companion of Soler\u00e0s (Oriol Pla) , who one way or another is obsessed with her ; and , taking the point of view of a black widow (Nuria Prims), concerning their troublesome experiences . Along the way Lluis investigates and finally discovers dark secrets about the widow , Black Spider-alike. In this search he betrays his own roots and seeks the terrible truth .Dark film with thrilling events , awesome performances , adequate settings and including a spotless as well as shading pictorial cinematography . The flick has some powerful , rousing images and occurs strong and downbeat happenings . This upsetting story of how war creates monsters is set in the harsh Civi war years' Catalan countryside . This is a thought-provoking flick dealing with astonishing events as well as a passionate retelling and a touching warlike drama with some historical insight . Being finely adapted by Agust\u00ed Villaronga himself from a novel written by Joan Sales about a twisted tale of treason , lies , punishment and retribution . This moving as well as strong story is an emotive recounting and an intense drama , including disturbing intrigues , tragedies , deaths and executions .The virtue of the movie is its style , resulting to be direct and simple and also captures the freshness of many authentic expressions, without ceasing to be Catalan literary, with many philosophical and provoking quotations. \"Uncertain glory\" bears remarkable resemblance to \u00a8Black beard\u00a8 resulting to be other of the uncountable stories to deal with dramatic deeds regarding the Civil War background . A familiar theme about the global horrors of a fratricide war , impossible to forget to Spanish Cinema , as the picture gives a deep detail about lives at a village set during Civil War and some atrocities being committed by Francoists as well as Republicans. It belongs a sub-genre that revolves around the themes of the civil war through the eyes of unsettling characters , as there is a great number of pictures about this engaging issues such as : \u00a8Secrets of heart\u00a8 by Montxo Armendariz , \u00a8Butterfly's Tongue\u00a8by Jose Luis Cuerda , \u00a8Viaje De Carol\u00a8 by Imanol Uribe and Pan's labyrinth by Guillermo Del Toro . Uncertain Glory (in Catalan Incerta gl\u00f2ria) is based on a novel from the Catalan-language writer and editor Joan Sales, first published in September 1956 and extended in successive subsequent editions until the final edition in 1971. However, this latter extension was titled \u00daltimes not\u00edcies (\"Latest news\"), although in later editions it was presented as an independent novel titled El vent de la nit (\"The wind of the night\"). Written by a witness of the defeated side, it contains no political message neither leaves an easy partisan exaltation. It reflects a pain that survives any propaganda from two factions: both the novel and poetry squires of the Falange as communist or republican writers. The writing of the novel lasted twenty-three years, expanded and worked incessantly. It was first published in September 1956 and extended in successive subsequent editions until the final edition in 1971. The French translation of 1962 contained texts that could not be read in the Catalan version .The novel won the Premi Joanot Martorell in 1955 and received good critical acclaim, starting by its French translation in 1962, where the book was compared with the work of writers such as Dostoevsky , Georges Bernanos or Julien Green. It is not strange comparison, as Dostoevsky was one of the favorite authors of Sales and therefore dare to make and edit an indirect translation, quite controversial, of The Brothers Karamazov . Agusti Villaronga also writes the script and being filmed in his usual formal and stylistic scholarship , without leaving a trace the thoughtful issues , in terms of dramatic and narrative excitement . The main problem has to face \"Uncertain glory\" , beyond not being able to avoid falling into the politic pamphlet is precisely derived from the coldness of its staging , which eventually become monotonous over 115 minutes of footage . This is a budget enough Spanish production and obtained moderate success in the Spaniard box office . Cast gives nice acting : Marcel Borr\u00e1s as a young republican officer destined for a temporarily dormant position , Nuria Prims as a deceitful femme-fatale , and Oriol Pl\u00e1 as a degraded officer who discovers the fraud committed by the widow and his friend . Excellent support cast forming an enjoyable human group of players and giving magnificent interpretations such as : Luisa Gavasa , Terele Pavez , Ju\u00e1n Diego and Fernando Esteso.Appropriate and evocative musical score by Marc\u00fas Jgr . Dark as well atmospheric cinematography by Joseph Maria Civit who has been working in several national and international productions . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Agusti Villaronga . It won a number of Gaud\u00ed Awards 2018 , such as : Gaud\u00ed Award Best Female Lead : N\u00faria Prim , Best Supporting Actor : Oriol Pla, Best Production Manager : Aleix Castell\u00f3n , Best Cinematography : Josep M. Civit , Best Costume Design : Merc\u00e8 Paloma , Best Sound : Xavier Mas , Fernando Novillo, Ricardo Galcer\u00e1n, Best Visual Effects : Lolo L\u00f3pez Egea , Bernat Aragon\u00e9s , Best Makeup and Hairstyles : Alma Casal . Filmmaker Agust\u00ed Villaronga was born in 1953 in Majorca, Balearic Islands, he uses to make films including genuine chills , suspense , mystery and dark atmospheres . His movies pack excellent creation of taut , thriller , emotions and rare atmospheres , such as : \u00a8Aro Tolbukhin\u00a8 , \u00a8El mar\u00a8 , \u00a8El Ni\u00f1o de la Luna\u00a8 and especially \u00a8In a glass cage\u00a8 or \u00a8Tras el Cristal\u00a8 . His greatest success was this \u00a8Black bread\u00a8 or Pa Negre\u00a8 winning several Goyas, this was first Catalan-language film to win the Goya Award for Best Film and Spain's official submission to the Best Foreign Language Film category of the 84th Academy Awards 2012 .",

I've always found her charming, but her prior leads roles were in Vampire Academy and Dirty Grandpa, which didn't inspire confidence in her career. The only things keeping me from truly loving this is that it's predictable in the end, and more importantly the score was an abomination ripped straight out of a Hallmark Channel original movie. It felt like someone flicking me in the face for 90 minutes.",

So 10 stars for 'Sairat' too! \u0095 This is undoubtedly a masterpiece of Cinema. Beautiful cinematography...flying birds, farms, sun, grass, plants and a well.\u0095 9 Rasa are used in the movie...I fill. \u0095 Acting part is very very natural. Characterization is unique yet so realistic. This makes movie all time fresh. Once you watch and you can't flavor of the movie ever.\u0095 Music is awesome...Not Overpowering the visuals. Unfortunately i not understanding the lyrics ...but still singing! \u0095 Sudden sarcasm, harshness and shown very beautifully.

The BG wasn't portrayed as a superwoman who had amazing insights and powers. It came across as she was slightly OCD about surveillance and escape routes (ain't we all?) and a little neurotic and distrustful (again, not a bad thing). The fight scenes were realistic insomuch she took a kicking as she was physically smaller, but possessed the will to drive on and fight out.All in all, it may not be an Oscar winner as it lacked entertainment value, but being a PPO isn't about providing entertainment. Personally, I think this is up there with 13 hrs in its portrayal of what the Private Security industry is about - poles apart, but professional",

    "review": "Review By : MarathiCineyug.comViacom 18 Motion Pictures presented 'Poshter Girl' is a laugh riot with a message. Though it gives couple of important social messages, director does ensure it is entertaining. Audiences are thoroughly entertained in a typical rural Maharashtrian setup of story.Female foeticide and Agriculture are the 2 subjects around which the story is neatly woven by writer and screenwriter Hemant Dhome. He has ensured that the movie is presented in a light and comic way, without losing the message.Story: Pargaon Tekawade is a small village in western Maharashtra, where there are no girls. The girls are either terminated or the wife and daughter are sent to their mother's village. Because of this you find only boys and these all boys are without marriage and wife.In such a village Rupali Thorat (Sonalee Kulkarni) comes to live with her uncle Kisanrao (Hrishikesh Joshi). Now all the boys start to woe her with gifts to marry her. She is an educated girl who loves farming and want to become an agriculture officer. She short- lists 5 men, Bharatrao Zende (Jitendra Joshi), Bajrang Dudhbhat (Aniket Vishwasrao), Arjun Kalal (Siddharth Menon) and twins Suresh & Ramesh (Sandeep Pathak, Akshay Tanksale), to take up a challenge, so that the best can win her in marriage.What happens next is the laugh riot and even challenges you to think about the social subjects.Acting: There are many characters in this movie and all the characters are well crafted and have their own trends. Each actor plays there part very well. Jitendra Joshi plays the vice Sarpanch with aplomb. Hrishikesh Joshi's uncle is well sketched. Sandeep Pathak, Aniket, Siddharth, Akshay does their roles very well.The plus point here is Sonalee Kulkarni, who has created the confident city girl who loves her roots and village, very naturally. She plays a completely different character than her earlier movies. Seems after Shutter, she is inclined more towards serious roles. 'Poshter Girl' could be a turning point in her acting career.Technical: The story and screenplay is the hero of this movie. All credit goes to Hemant Dhome for developing such a master-piece. Director Sameer Patil presents the movie ensuring there are no dull moments and the pace of the movie is maintained throughout. Dialogues are witty in typical Western Maharashtrian dialect.Music and background score by Amitraj are good and all the 4 songs are entertaining. Special mention to 'DJ Song' and 'Lavani Song'. Pushpank Gawade's Cinematography is excellent. Editing by Kshitija Khandagale could have been better, especially during scene changes, there could have been fillers.Overall: 'Poshter Girl' is a perfect comic entertainer with social message. Each character is well crafted by writer and director. For Sonalee, this is going to be a mile-stone movie, as she is the hero of 'Poshter Girl'. Go watch this one for the sheer entertainment.Rating: 4 / 5Movie: Poshter Girl Director: Sameer Patil Producer: Hadi Ali Abrar and Pushpank Gawade Studios: Viacom 18 Motion Pictures and Chalo Film Banaye Cast: Sonalee Kulkarni, Jitendra Joshi, Aniket Vishwasrao, Siddharth Menon, Hemant Dhome, Sandeep Pathak, Akshay Tanksale and Hrishikesh Joshi.

Making a documentary is a lot more unpredictable than a fiction film, where practically every story decision is conscious. As far as edition, direction, camera-work and all other artistic aspects can go to present a story, it's still only SO far. It's not rare for a documentary's story to go in all sorts of unexpected directions thanks to the people, subjects and/or events depicted.As a documentary focused on a specific place (Milan's Reffetorio Ambrosiano soup kitchen) during a specific time (Expo Milan 2015), \"Theater of Life\" would seem to have a limited focus, useful to prevent the film from becoming too dispersed. The subject being food waste, which is personally one of my biggest pet peeves, would've apparently made me judge it favorably as I agree with most of the opinions on the matter shown on the film. However, despite the focus being so limited and the subject so personal, the film unexpectedly ends up following a few too many threads and boarding a few too many subjects to be an in-depth portrayal of any of them.Then again, it never really seems to want to be that. This is a humanist documentary, about human emotions (Bottura's ambition not to see leftover Expo ingredients go to waste like so much food around the world does on a daily basis, the diners' different desires, including the ultimately humanistic one of not wanting to be judged by one's conditions and habits but for WHO THEY ARE) from all sorts of humans (top chefs like Bottura and Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, refugee, migrant and Italian diners, religious and charity workers involved in the Reffetorio). Its humanist agenda might ultimately make the film feel like a somewhat superficial look of it subjects and not as engrossing as it could've been but it still seems to be the filmmakers' actual target.Much like most of the chefs' ideals, which come off as a bit naive and idealistic when contrasted with the diners' not hopeless but more realistic and jaded ones, \"Theater of Life\" might seem that way in comparison to far more in-depth and objective food and food waste documentaries. It is still an emotional look into the lives of the \"less fortunate ones\" and with this focus, it might actually end up being more effective in portraying the absurdity of the current worldwide food waste and homelessness crises than other \"drier\" ones. There's also a balancing act in documentaries between emotion and objectivity, specially in terms of which works best for a specific purpose. While I might not have fully agreed with this film's balance, I can still understand and respect it.",

If neither victim nor perpetrator are native, a county or state officer must make the arrest. If the perpetrator is non-native and the victim an enrolled member, only a federally-certified agent has that right. If the opposite is true, a tribal officer can make the arrest, but the case must still go to federal court. This quagmire creates a jurisdictional nightmare by choking up the legal process on reservations to such a degree, many criminals go unpunished indefinitely for serious crimes.",
    "review": "Although very, very small errors crept in this story it is very true. As someone who lived right off the Wind River Reservation and whose husband worked for the Northern Arapaho tribe (one of three non-native employees) I can say that without a doubt this is what happens too many times on the res there. The natives often live in deplorable conditions but it's not all the other guy's fault either. However, the treatment of women and the disappearance of women, and yes men too, is horrific. There is often no closure. Things are so confusing and convoluted and corrupt that it's no surprise these things happen. We've since moved away but some of the experiences and events will never be gone. I wish that the people there, on and off the res, can find some resolution to the atrocities. It's a beautiful area and everyone should visit the Wind River mountains. It's on most people's way to the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone. Stop at Brooks lake and see the beginning of the Wind River. And the rest of the beauty there. Just don't go up on the res unless you're with a local.",

It had everything you want when watching a sci-fi, nice futuristic concept, a good intriguing story, and a good cast. Clive Owen and Amanda Seyfried, as well as the rest of the cast, made this movie enjoyable to watch.

But the movie fails us on the most important aspect. It doesn't present us the results. There's no data or information to be gained regarding the specific unique situation here portrayed. Instead, we are shown what an year in space looks like. Definitely interesting, just wasted potential.

    "review": "Set in 2008, this indie is more of a relationship drama than a comedy, and is filled with lots of imperfect characters. It's a quiet movie where for the most part the characters come off as real persons. However, in my opinion, not everything works here and, at times, the movie seems to veer off into places it didn't need to go to be effective.Addison Timlin is terrific in the lead role of Colleen, who's a nun novitiate in a Brooklyn convent. She's temporarily traveling home to Asheville, N.C., after a 3 year absence, at the request of her mother Joani (Ally Sheedy). Sheedy plays up to the hilt her role of the disturbed and drug taking mom.The principal reason for Colleen's return home is to emotionally support her brother Jacob, most ably portrayed by Keith Poulson, who has been severely disfigured by a bomb blast while serving as a Marine in the war. Now, Jacob is extremely isolative and depressed and is suffering both physically and mentally. Thus, the remainder of the film will center on Colleen's attempts to help her brother, remembrances of her goth past, as well as trying to interact and cope with the remainder of her dysfunctional family,All in all, this indie, written and directed, by Zach Clark, certainly has its moments, but I felt, as mentioned, it was too overloaded with on screen drug use and at times veered \"off the tracks\". Therefore, I would say despite its uplifting ending this was a mixed bag for me.",

Life is complicated for Ariel, finding his feet back home, fighting his feelings for a love interest and reminiscing about the past - sometimes, a really good movie doesn't have to have a clear linear plot and this doesn't really but it is about a part of Buenos Aires that doesn't get that much exposure but in this film, it does a good job of showing us how it is for some of the people who have lived there for generations.It's not for everyone and if you're one for car chases and people getting shot then give it a miss but if you like subtle character driven films then give it a go.",

Spending so much on location, songs and dance would not give inception of a good film unless script is thoroughly worked upon. There is no definition of Story, Script and direction tin Judwaa 2. The main drama unfolds in the later reel which again is intolerable with screenplay written by a school kid. Editing is horrible. The torture goes on for almost 2.25 hours. Art direction is good. Cinematography is nice. Songs are tuneful (again all the songs. baring one, is lifted straight from the original. Dialogues are less-impacting. Performances are over- topOverall, a pathetic film in every sense. Poor- 1/5",

Cmon, the young version of Yu Jun-su is tall (at least 6\") but the older version is short and not as handsome as the young actor. He was supposedly a popular boy in school. But the adult version is very reserve. The film didn't let us know why Jang Guk decided to changed her name? another loophole is the family just decided to let go of the accident that lead to the miscarriage of a pregnancy? Seriously?? and the mean girl Ju Da-hae just go on with her life as if nothing happened? I mean, she is even friends with Jun-su. what a psychopath!The story line about Ju Da-hae's family is tiring and boring to watch.A very subpar K drama",

From the BA tour to the release of TOD, Madonna was the center of the universe. Her PR at the time said she was giving the dancers an opportunity and it was up to them to exploit it after the tour. (This was never mentioned in the film but is my recollection.) Sadly, none have achieved what would be considered success in the material sense: most seem to live hand to mouth. If they had more maturity and some good guidance at the time, they may have developed careers of note - perhaps even judging DWTS and choreographing big names but mostly spiraled down and those that sued Madge? Well, let's just say she holds a grudge. This doc is a little sad, yet their impact at the time on some was significant. Ultimately, this will appeal more to those of us born in the 60s - mid-70s and does not have wide appeal. Yes, Madonna exploited them but in her world view she also gave them an opportunity.",

This is an interesting look at the life of \"Barry\", who isn't a politician and has no interest in politics at all. It looks at conflict, race, trying to fit into two worlds and not feeling like you belong in either... It's about learning who you are in a world that isn't sure where it thinks you belong. It was a wonderfully interesting peek into a time that helped to shape the man who would go on to be the leader of the free world.A very good watch if you can manage to set your political affiliations aside for long enough to actually watch it.",

It was a well paced journey (left my wife and i wanting more), with authentic fight scenes and sounds; as well as interesting relationships and lessons in duty, sacrifice and care. Suspenseful, adventurous, romantic, emotional and dramatic; better than nearly all of the old 1940s and 1950s westerns; and more classy than the most of the post-Wayne, Stewart, and Scott ones.

    "review": "Normally I do not have the habit of writing movie reviews since I consider myself a bad writer (and just plain lazy), yet I do feel a strong need to write one for Bugs (obviously I'm going to be the first user who writes a review on it, where are the other viewers??)BUGS is a documentary that follows the research team of Nordic Food Lab's Edible Insects Project as they explore different insect cuisine cultures around the globe and discuss the problems and possibilities existing in the food systems. Before going to the movie, I made the extra effort of repeatedly reminding my friend not to buy any snack. After all, this documentary is all about people shovelling down giant larvas, worms, ants and bees etc... So it didn't seem like a very sensible thing to do if we were gonna eat during the movie without carrying any vomit bag. But I couldn't be more wrong. Not only were the insects eating scenes nowhere near disgusting, but we even found some of them very intriguing and even to the extent of being appetizing. The satisfaction and the joy that present themselves on the smiles and laughter of the local people when they discover and enjoy the insects are just amazing to watch. And the way they treat insects as real food and cook them with such enthusiasm and dedication is an equal amazement. I also absolutely love how the main characters make really vivid and unexpectedly interesting descriptions of the flavours of the different insects they have tasted along their global exploration. Some of them sound so magical that my friend and I wished we were there to verify the magic with our own taste buds.I was not only wrong about the insects eating scenes, but I was wrong about the whole movie. It turns out that the movie goes a lot deeper than just watching people digging some insects out deep from the earth and then eating them cooked or alive. There are a lot of discussion about the possible good and harm of the rapidly attention grabbing insect eating culture. This is also another thing that makes me appreciate this movie so much. It is very honest about the limitations and the controversy of what they (the research team) want to achieve. They don't just blindly advocate insect eating; instead they take into consideration the possible outcome of a profitable insect protein industry and reflect on the necessity of insect eating. My only complaint for this documentary is that it is way too short. There are a lot more insect cooking and eating footages that are not shown in the movie. I would have loved to sit for another hour or so to watch more of them if it wasn't for the murdering air conditioning and my carelessness of never remembering to bring a jacket to the cinema.",

    "review": "--- Minor Spoilers ahead (but don't worry too much, as I've wrote down the next line, I don't know much to give it away) --- 3 episodes in is not much, so I'll make this quick.The story revolves around Jean, this psychologist who is married and has a little trans girl. Love how they approach the subject like: \"It's complicated, but hell, it happens.\" And then it moves on to the main story: Jean is \"effing\" crazy. Well, not so much. She has anxiety issues and for some reason, starts entering her patients' acquaintances (or family, or whatever) lives, and it really makes no sense (to me) as to why is she doing that, because we aren't given much on her state of mind. We only know about what's on her mind when she's thinking of Sidney (Yes, that's a girl, and yes, it's quite gay what they have there). Sexual tension ensues. Besides that, we get to see Jean's day-to-day life. And it's quite boring. Sure, the series has potential, but I have a feeling that the \"Thriller\" tag on IMDb is a little bit (completely, as of now) off. It's simple cheesy melodrama. Buuuut, I'm still hoping it will spiral down to hell with this little bullshit she's doing (meddling with patients lives). However, I enjoy when suddenly all characters are in a room with a gun in their hands, each pointing to the next and before you know it, blood is everywhere. That's my kind of movie (or series). And that's what I'm hoping for here, so I'm biased when it comes to guessing an ending that is not terrible. For those of you who don't like that gory, tense, climax thingy, rest assured, I doubt it will happen. I'm even starting to hope for a happy (and gay) ending! But given the circumstances, it's kinda hard to believe it will go so smoothly.The opening and ending sequences tracks are fantastic (so far), and I can't wait for someone to upload the soundtrack to YouTube, so I can listen to it and reminisce about the series. And preferably, cry in a corner while doing so.Hmm... what else?Naomi Watts is great as always, but I'm afraid Billy Crudup just can't keep up. He has this face, that no matter how mad he's supposed to be, his eyes make it seem like he's having a great time at a party in a Bahamas beach. While on ecstasy. I don't even know why I thought (or wrote) that. Anyways, the little girl is cute and is fantastic. I see a future for her. Or not. You know child actors. Sophie Cookson and Karl Glusman are given lesser roles but they nail it nonetheless. The others non-important characters are also great, specially the pill addicted redhead that doesn't show up much. I expect great things from her. About the technical stuff, there isn't much to say, it's quite straightforward and by the book, and I wouldn't want to bore you with details. Let's just say it's good.Concluding, Gypsy gives off a psychological thriller vibe, but doesn't push that aspect throughout the series (or rather, the 3 episodes I've watched) degrading itself to a simple melodrama (\"Should I cheat or should I go?\"). Nonetheless, it's very intriguing, to the point it's rendering me unable to stop the classic (is it classic already?) Netflix marathon.Watch it. Give it time. And then we'll see. Or not, because if you stop watching it, it's only gonna be me seeing it...",

Of course it's not a master piece, you cannot compare this movie with an Oscar winning one, but it was pretty good. It's a romantic comedy after all.The story revolves around Renata (Danna Paola) who has been in love with his brother's best friend Leonardo (Alosian Vivancos), since for ever. He's 10-12 years older than her, but that doesn't stop Renata's feelings. She's a pretty, popular, rich girl, who has everything in life except what she really wants: Leonardo.On summer, the family decides to go on vacation to Puerto Vallarta, his brother invites his best friend Leonardo, Renata invites her best friend, and it's sure going to be a very fun vacation, until Renata finds out that Leonardo has a new girlfriend and that he's planning to marry her. Now she has to elaborate a plan to stop the wedding and tell Leonardo about her feelings!This romantic comedy was made in such a format, that it has a lot of other famous movies references, like American Beauty, Gone with the Wind, Saturday Night Fever, etc. which in my opinion, it's kind of fun, except the 70's dance scene, lasted too long, in my opinion.I understand this is not the film of the year, but it's very entertaining and decent. I am Mexican and I know the actors, they work in telenovelas (Mexican soap operas), so I am familiar with them. So, if you feel like laughing a bit, watch this movie and entertain yourself.",

There were a couple of slow parts and I think you notice them because most movies have a lot more action. Whereas this movie just told a story with a really basic message. Even though it's a teen movie I think the message transcends to any age. You need to see the whole thing to understand why it is good, and after you watch it you think about. The movie left me hopeful. Feels weird but I don't hate it.I took off one star due to a couple awkward scenes that have been over played in all movie plots.",

Eventually, those associated with the signing move on; and the player who most identifies with the fans' cause becomes the new captain. Ultimately, football is a business; without other incentives, you can't make money by upsetting your customers. The undertone here, of course, is that in polarised Israeli society, the notion of ethnic purity might have an appeal that stretches far beyond the terraces. As a documentary, there's nothing extraordinary about this film; its power comes in the sad but clear view of reality it presents.",

Peyton List was enough for me to watch it. I haven't seen the original movie and i guess that makes it more sweeter. Don't care about the science and how much it makes sense in reality but it indulges you and that should be enough.Looking forward for next episode.Give it a try. Thanks CW. 8.5/10",

Even being without kids, myself, and crossing an age when life tends to fold on a single decision, I found it nearly impossible to wrap my head around the reality of the process and accept that it often drains everything short of a soul out of those trying to create life. Then came this film. Perfectly scripted, brilliantly performed, and intimately directed, this 2-hour Indie caused me to feel as I was eavesdropping on the private moments of a middle-aged couple going through its greatest crisis.

It's an interesting story to watch, a bit sad but told in a funny way, probably just like he would have wanted it. It's just too bad there wasn't a small part for the real comedians from those movies, that would have been a nice addition. But watching Will Forte is always funny. Since the series The Last Man On Earth I'm a big fan of him. The cast was just very good for this movie, mostly comedians better known from comedy series, but none of them has to prove anything anymore as they are all funny. The movie is well shot, never a dull moment, and it's a story that is worth to be told. National Lampoon is a name everybody knows or has heard of, and this movie is a nice hommage to one of the co-founders, maybe a bit excentric, certainly not a fully happy man, but with a fascinating life.",

Trailers did show some nasty shots so I gave it a try.Is it worth watching, well if you are into action or horrors that give you the creeps then this isn't a good choice but if you do like psychological horrors with a twist then I recommend it.The opening sequence of Clinical offers some nasty shots because it involves a child doing awful things. Once after that this flick turns into a flick about characterisation and psychology. I can't go too deep into the story because I would be spoiling. Here and there it do gives some bloody scenes but it's at the end that the real horror comes back and the red stuff do sputter around. The ending will leave you with a few questions.Overall i enjoyed it but I solved the puzzle quickly. Some say that a lot of scene's were too dark and I agree here and there. The effects used were above mediocre and done on-camera without CGI. This flick will have his pro's but also a lot of contra's because it's a mixture of horror (begin and ending) and a thriller.

The cast is what's most remarkable to me. Most Final Fantasy games present a cast that is very much inspired by Japanese culture and Anime. For the first time, we see a diverse cast that feels rather universal than from one specific culture.To me, the cast surpassed the ones presented in the video game by miles and miles. I wasn't really into the cast of Final Fantasy XV from the beginning, except for Gladio. But here, the cast was wonderful by every mean.The world is absolutely amazing, the CGI is top-notch, the story is very interesting and sets the foundation of what could be a brilliant trilogy, or more.My only complaint would be that I was hoping to see more of the world, instead of being restricted to few places, but I believe the game will handle that.All in all, the movie is a brilliant work of art that critiques couldn't be more wrong about giving it such low scores.

I do think it's much more faithful to the source material then the live action Death Note was, like Death Note it is a very ambitious movie trying to pack a lot of story into a short amount of time. As a result, some characters are omitted and the story is condensed.\nTo be honest, it felt like I was watching a fan-made movie with a big budget. This is not a bad thing, actually it was refreshing because it makes me believe those who worked on it really cared deeply about the original anime and did their best to show it.\nOther reviewer's issues with the show are right, the acting wasn't the best and I would have liked to have seen more comedy. Also elements of the story were passed over or not explained.\nWhat I did like was the homunculus, I thought they were done very well. While the story was condensed, it was still easy to follow and the movie had a good (sometimes too fast) pace.",

    "plot": "Alexandra Borb\u00e9ly and Ervin Nagy are a couple in real life.",
    "review": "ON BODY AND SOUL is an invigorating comeback of Hungarian filmmaker Ildik\u00f3 Enyedi, her first feature film in 18 years which stimulatingly dances away with the Golden Bear in Berlin. The plot can be basically boiled down as follows: when a lonely man meets a lonely woman, how the pair fumbles to build an authentic connection without forfeiting their individuality, because both are crippled in very different terms, for a middle-aged Endre (Morcs\u00e1nyi), it is his corporal handicap, a liability which might explain why he is a singleton, but for the young Maria (Borb\u00e9ly), her condition is far more unusual and intriguing, she seems to be stuck in a limbo of emotionally arrested development, equipped with no social skills, and eschews human contact of any sort, but in accordance with the less unconventional \"idiot savant\" trope, she is also endowed with a preternatural power of memory, which might fairly explain her credentials as a quality inspector, newly appointed to work in Endre's abattoir, where he assumes the job as the chief financial officer. Despite of its well-trodden narrative arc, ON BODY AND SOUL refreshingly channels a mystical dream-reality correlation between the two protagonists, embodied in their shared dreamscape as a stag and a doe and through a subplot of psychological assessment, its earth-shattering revelation is comically underlined by Kl\u00e1ra (a voluptuous R\u00e9ka Tenki and an uncanny Jennifer Lawrence doppelg\u00e4nger), the psychiatrist who is in a snit of believing that she has been taken for a ride (indeed, comical elements are friskily deployed throughout). It is this paranormal tie-in propels their bonding in motion, which reverberates as a sobering call, how could these two isolated souls even start a tentative gesture if there were no such beggar belief fabrication to break the humongous glacier between them, one must venerate Enyedi for her keen insight of the intrinsic difficulty apropos of human interactions, and her diligent craftsmanship of balancing the dream- reality dyad with an intimate but non-judgmental outlook amid the film's gorgeous imagery. It is still a bumpy road ahead after that, not least for the tabula-rosa Maria, who really steps out of her comfort zone and out on a limb to prepare herself for the ineluctable carnal ritual, but at the same time, her gawkiness sends many a wrong signal to an increasingly frustrated Endre, who is self-aware of their gaping age difference and dubious of his own potency. When the crunch comes Enyedi doesn't flinch from radically bringing a splurge of red into play, even if it offends the squeamish, which is not dissimilar with the slaughterhouse mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, viewers are impelled to stare at pain and gore vis-\u00e0-vis, because cruelty is the staple among human beings, whether we (sometimes even obliviously) cast it on our own kind or lesser beings. The two leading performances are of high caliber, dramaturgist G\u00e9za Morcs\u00e1nyi is well at ease with Endre's resigned, contemplative demeanor tinged with a smidgen of sophistication, whereas a doe-eyed (no puns intended!) Alexandra Borb\u00e9ly is simply mesmerizing to hold our attention from stem to stern, often appears like an ethereal creature with her impassive lineaments, and registers her unaffected agenda at the same time in pinpoint economy. Mournfully honed in Laura Marling's WHAT HE WROTE, the thematic dirge bewitches Maria and audience alike, ON BODY AND SOUL reaches its crescendo with a hard-earned happy ending, when magic dissipates, a new lease on life is inaugurated, which could be also read as a herald of Enyedi's own future, career-wise. In fact, she is a few years younger than G\u00e9za Morcs\u00e1nyi in real life, so guaranteed by this fascinating love story, her next offering looks pretty buoyant, with only one proviso, the waiting time must be significantly pared down, an 18-year hiatus is an egregious waste of her talent.",

This could be happening because the movie revolves more around psychological and emotional aspects of both dragons and humans insted of bloody wars and fights as you would see in, for example, game of thrones.I think Rafaella de Laurentis is giving her fans something that is almost non-existant in the movie market. Yes, the plot is extremelly weak, as have been all of the Dragonheart plots after the first movie. The dragons and the effects are probably not the best in Hollywood either. But these movies keep coming out despite their poor economic revenues, and that's something dragon fans should be greatful for.NOT EVERYBODY likes beastly, evil, brainless, pet dragons as those of games of thrones. When I picture a dragon, I picture a wise, elder creature, just as these movies present them. If I want to see a winged dinosaur out of control, Hollywood is full of them. I am more than willing to sacrifice CGI perfection just to see dragons as those from the DragonHeart franchise. I've fallen in love with every one of them. The plot, however, should be improved. The first DragonHeart had an awesome plot and I'm sure they can go back to that.",

    "review": "Shows like The Mist and The Walking Dead are based on a very simple premise of threat (usually super/bio/natural) and the need for survival as a group in challenging circumstances. These shows can pull in good audiences, but it is impressive how frequently this simple premise cannot be executed boldly and instead runs off into a series of sub-plots that detract from the core premise until the core premise is lost. The Mist suffers this fate. First, the premise is sound enough. The simplicity of the idea is its great attraction. The problem with this show is, like TWD the premise becomes secondary to the sub-plots and poor character decisions that then consume the show. So, Stephen King penned 'The Mist' - it's an alternate take on 'The Fog' just taking the concept in a different direction. In this envisioning the Mist descends on a small town in the US cutting of communication and isolating the town. Within the realms of this genre, this is a suitable plot that comes with full license for the associated suspension of disbelief. We have a good set. The weakness then is the lack of courage to execute on the core premise, instead drifting into the sub plots of the various irrational characters. If this show had been given the benefit of stronger oversight of the storyline this might not have led to the shows demise and could with the right writing have seen additional seasons tagged on.When a writer must fall back on the stupidity of characters to carry the story then you know the series is in trouble. Even B movies fans like intelligent characters in B movies. The Mist is a missed opportunity - a show that should have had a stronger tighter focus on the core plot. Less silly character sub plots. A clearer definition of what it was and a willingness to stay true to that. I believe there is still very much a market for this type of a show - if only writers of sufficient quality could be found to build the episodes that build ON the core premise, not away from it.",

    "review": "Considering the others reviews of this movie i almost lost the opportunity to see it for myself.I think the movie was really well done and every piece was satisfactory, not every movie needs to have some plain ending. This movie had good actors, good writing, nice edit and a good ending. I may be wrong but i think people are criticizing this movie that hard because they couldn't understand it. Not a masterpiece, but considering the budget and the way the movie was made it was really good. It gave the viewers the information in small doses, small twists and good writing.Thanks Netflix for the opportunity to watch another good movie. See it for yourself.",

    "review": "This film immerses us into the world of lower-class people in Florida who ironically are staying in a cheap hotel next to of Disneyworld, where a set of four magic band bracelet tickets goes for $1600. There are excellent performances all around, especially from Brooklynn Prince, who plays a tough, mouthy, and yet sweet little girl with an arresting honesty. The character is just six but in many ways seems older, growing up too quickly while left mostly on her own to roam around with her friends.It doesn't take long to feel sorry for the children in this situation, with no structure or guidance, and horrible role models. In ten years we can easily imagine the little girl grown up to be a similar mother, and ten years ago we can imagine how the mother must have grown up. Without even a hint of this message from director Sean Baker, who shows masterful restraint, we see how hard it is for someone to rise out of the lower class or a difficult upbringing - not impossible, but not easy. The film may be an ink blot test though, because I can also imagine the response of them getting what they deserve, since the mom doesn't get a job as others around her do, runs scams, and resorts to prostituting herself, and I have to say, feeling empathy for her is a real test. Just watching how poorly she behaves is one of the turn-offs to the film, even if it's honest.The little girl is easy to feel sorry for because she's still just six; this is what happens with awful parents. But the mother was also likely brought up in a difficult environment, so the film begs the question of what to do about vicious cycles like this while wisely not attempting to answer it. Instead it just gives us reality, as cringe-inducing as it may be at times.I loved how it was edited, with cuts tending to shorten scenes. I think that was a wise move, since a lot of the film is simply showing us a series of vignettes without the machinations of a big plot, and this kept it from lagging. I also loved the character Willem Dafoe played - what a tough job he has, and yet he's a model of empathy and kindness, an absolute angel under the fa\u00e7ade of a grizzled hotel manager, never judging anyone. He plays the part perfectly too, without embellishing it with sweetness or anything that doesn't feel completely authentic. How it resolves is great too, because you can see both the tragedy and the need for it, after everything we've seen.",

Saturday Church introduces Ulysses to the voguing scene, and the film gives us plenty of music to hear and voguing to watch.It's discouraging that we still need places like Saturday Church, but at least they are there. (There really is a Saturday Church in NYC.)I enjoyed this film because of the great performance by Luka Kain. (Performance in the sense of acting, as well as performance in the sense of voguing.) To a certain extent, it opened a window to the world of drag queens. It also reminded me that, even in 2017, in the United States, it still isn't easy being openly gay. I think that all of us need that reminder.We saw this movie at Rochester's great Little Theatre, as part of the wonderful ImageOut, the LGBT Film Festival.

As a theatrical offering, it doesn't have the grandeur or the scares to cross over into adult or teen market. In addition, it's tough to sell parents to take their little kids to a horror movie. It's stuck somewhere in no man's land. It needs to be a little darker and a little more theatrical to get the teens. Jack Black phones in his fifteen minutes and delivers one good joke. The kids are fine but nothing that special. The writing misses a few things. Sarah needs to physically write in the book with a pen to wrap up that aspect of the story.

Jeff Baena's The Little hours confirms what we always suspected: The younger nuns and postulants actually had firm breasts and world-class hormones.Handyman Masseto (Dave Franco) hides in a convent in 1347 medieval Italy as a deaf mute (no doubt the way some women consider men anyway). Malaspina Castle would remind you of the iconic castle in Monty Python and The Holy Grail, and their English vernacular evokes the abandon of Mel Brooks' several satires. While the young nuns explore their interest in the forbidden, especially sex of several kinds, the jokes are weak by comparison with Python, Brooks, and even Boccaccio's Decameron, on which this film is loosely based.Not just the randy nuns and handyman violate the Church's dictates against freewheeling sex, the venerable overseer, Father Tomasso (John C. Reilly), is carrying on with an older nun while listening to the salacious details of the younger nuns' sins in confession. Reilly is always competent displaying a simple man's wonder at the underbelly of the world.In grammar school a nun shouted me out for holding a girl's hand, calling me a \"dirty thing.\" I had more laughs over that kerfuffle than during The Little Hours, where laughs are in limited supply while the parody of sanctimonious medieval religiosity is mildly rich. But not rich enough to eclipse the wit of Python and Brooks.\"I did 12 years with nuns, you know. So I came out of it going, like, 'I think Jesus is all right.' The rest of it I think stinks to the high heavens.\" Denis Leary",

    "review": "XIX century Spain, Basque country, endless wars need endless fodder, and who else would serve that purpose better than poor and destitute. Age old story repeating cyclically to these days. Surviving the war was hard enough but coming home in one piece was even more important. Crippled peasant was no good to anybody, just one more hungry mouth to feed. This heartbreaking movie filmed in harsh, almost unreal terrain tells this saga almost like a fairytale with a giant and a cripple in its center. Two brothers dealt the worst cards in the game of life plod through faraway lands as a part of a cruel freak show. Even having a choice makes one privileged, our heroes have none, just bare-knuckle fight for survival, till the bones break and all mercifully ends.",

The band, which is called Healing Hearts, was formed in the Adarsh Karagar, just on the outskirts of Lucknow. In 2007, the then senior superintendent of the jail, V K Jain, decided to set up a band from Lucknow to participate in the annual event where inmates from different central prisons across Uttar Pradesh came together to showcase their talent. Funds were raised, and 15 instruments were bought. Twelve men sentenced to life imprisonment for murder came together and were trained by Noor Mohammad, a prison guard, who grew up learning music, as his father played in a private band.\nThe band worked hard to give a fantastic performance on Republic Day, and since then, there has been no looking back for them. From private parties to weddings, the band has become popular at all kinds of events. Due to popular demand, they learnt to play latest Bollywood hits and such is their fan following that there is no shortage of bookings, sometimes even from out of Lucknow.\nThere is a booking counter for the band, and the members head back to jail after every performance, since they are still serving their term.",
    "review": "Tone, Script & Story: It is shown as the movie ends that the story is inspired from true events. It would have been better if the same was conveyed along with the trailer as biographies have their own audience. The story is how an innocent man is convicted of murder of IAS officer, gets jail term, and plans jail escape by forming music band. The further story is if they escape or not and or what term he gets.I don't know if life in jail is shown well. A person in grip of crime has life of false person. A NGO coming in showing faith providing path to jail members to redeem themselves and getting not one or two but five of them seems abrupt. Here's where story falls week.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Ranjit Tiwari shines in his maiden attempt as a director. Screenplay is relaxing, when convicts are made to play music instruments and are left on pay role, everywhere else screenplay goes well with the story (example life in jail). Cinematography was also good.Music: Music is good. I personally liked the track Rangdaari.Acting: Acting was good by most of the actors. All actors who do not act in non sense cinema have done well here in this movie as well.Final Verdict: It is worth a watch [(2/5) (7/10)].",

I'm on Episode 10 and I can already say this show has completely transformed since the beginning. You begin to see real sides of Sophia which helps explain the reason she is the way she is, and like all people there's more that meets the eye. Yes she can be selfish and annoying (but as someone that works with teenagers daily.... THIS IS what a lot of our youth are like!) - it doesn't mean they don't have hearts of gold and good intentions and are good people - they just can't help it! But I digress...Basically, at first I was annoyed by her character but I have grown to love her andddd continue to love her best friend, Annie. Their relationship perfectly sums up true friendship and their dialogue is absolutely hilarious (well all the dialogue is hilarious really. Each relationship Sophia has with other characters is unique and genuine). If you enjoy the humour of shows like New Girl and Brooklyn 99 - you will enjoy the crude, inappropriate and brilliant writing this show has to offer.DON'T give up after the first few episodes. Make it to at least Episode 5 where we find out how Annie and Sophia became friends. I promise you won't be disappointed!",

The two leads are also very strong, especially Melanie Lynskey who has proved herself to be more than capable of leading roles time and time again. She deserves more attention in general.

    "review": "What a strange filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos is. Had I not already seen \"The Lobster\" (2015) (and have since seen two of his earlier Greek productions), I probably would've been completely taken aback by this one, \"The Killing of a Sacred Deer.\" Like its predecessor, its characters seem to occupy some alternate reality entirely dominated by egocentrism, deviant sex and magical retaliatory justice. Again, the acting is intentionally stilted, and there seem to be archaic literary references. I found the eye-for-an-eye pun of \"The Lobster\" amusing, but the source of Ancient-to-Classical Greek mythology here is quite a treat for me. At university, I took a class, not unlike the daughter in this movie, that included reading the play \"Iphigenia in Aulis\" by Euripides and, then, viewing the 1977 film adaptation \"Iphigenia\" directed by Mihalis Kakogiannis. Unfortunately, the result in \"The Killing of a Sacred Deer\" is rather muddled.In the Greek myth, King Agamemnon sacrifices his daughter, Iphigenia, at the behest of the goddess Artemis to allow him and his troops to proceed on the warpath to fight the Trojans. In some versions, Iphigenia is replaced by a deer, hence the title of this movie. The reason I don't think the effects work as well here as they did in \"The Lobster\" is because whereas that movie took human shortcomings to absurd extremes, this one takes what was already by modern standards an absurd myth and attempts to make it modern and more ordinary. Gods are dead and replaced by doctors, and if there is a god, apparently, he's a pockmarked teenager seeking revenge for his dead father. I suppose a surgeon's wife role playing during sex as a patient under general anesthesia and a father recalling to his son the time he masturbated his father is more in line with some of the sexual perversity one finds in some Classical Greek literature, though. Yet, overall, it comes across as disjointed. If this were supposed to be a psychological thriller, it seems difficult to lure the spectator in without being able to identify with the characters--whereas this was unnecessary in the black comedy of \"The Lobster\" (and contradictory to the intent of the Greek movies). But, the stilted acting and illogical premise of the narrative works against identification. I don't think any amount of tense scoring and camera movement from distant perspectives can alleviate that--in a world where nothing is sacred.P.S. I still don't quite get the point of \"Groundhog Day\" (1993) as the film-within-the-film. Is it just because characters in both are prisoners of fate or something? I prefer the self-reflexivity of the director's prior \"Dogtooth\" (2009) and \"Alps\" (2011).",

    "review": "Netflix's Small Crimes is a bitter, barren, gnarled piece of work that leaves an uneasy vacuum in the air as it passes. If you haven't heard of it yet, that's because the platform does almost zero promotion when new content comes off the assembly line, quietly slipping it onto the site without so much as a TV spot. Some are forgettable, and some are gems that could have done with a bit of buildup. This one is like David Mamet, Cormac McCarthy and Elmore Leonard sipping whiskey sours one cold, empty night and brainstorming ideas. I love the time honoured themes presented here, but what I love and admire more is the filmmaker's courage in completely subverting, perverting and putrefying the formula. There's countless films about disgraced cops, criminals or what- have-you who return home to a small town with designs on putting the wrong things right and finding a modicum of redemption. Thing is, in 99.999% of these films, we end up with a happy ending where all the kinks are ironed out and bygones are left as such, a trend which really cripples the stakes and grinds our expectations down with a blunt, predictable Hollywood ending. Not this one. Nikolai Koster-Waldau, aka Jamie Lannister, is a wiry, cracked out ex con who used to be a cop, before he viciously, and I do mean viciously, sliced up the town DA at the behest of a crime kingpin. Moping back into the county following a six year stretch in the pen, it's inevitable that his very presence will stir up a few noxious vibes. Sure enough, he runs into trouble from all angles, including the vengeful DA (\", looking like he shaves with a wheat thresher), a scummy corrupt detective (Gary Cole eats up the dialogue like candy), the mobsters he used to be employed by, and even his parents (Robert Forster & Jacki Weaver), who are clearly broken by the past. There's a feeling of inescapable doom, an inevitable choking quicksand that Waldau wades deeper into, his seemingly noble intent on reconnecting with his wife and daughters gradually ground away to reveal the true nature of his path, and it ain't pretty. Gary Cole has a way with words and mannerisms, and he runs away with his bent cop role, stealing scenes like nobody's business. Forster has salt of the earth gravitas in spades, and nails a near career best scene with clear eyed conviction, nailing our attention to his presence. It's not a perfect film though, there's pacing issues, sometimes it gets a little vague or scattered and a romantic subplot involving a nurse (Molly Parker) seems glaringly out of place. Waldau anchors it though, a twitchy, unpredictable ne'er do well who seems cosmically incapable of getting his act together. The ending floored my expectations and remind that there is hope for fresh narratives and abstract thinking amongst writers. You'll come out of this one bruised, but you'll be glad you sat through the beating.",

She is drawn to him like she would be any other man. The movie highlights, for me, how often youth and women are underestimated in movies, especially ones like these. Younger guys aren't always stupid boy toys or hot, forbidden affairs, and moms are not all Mrs. Robinson. Watch this movie for a laugh, a blush, and a somewhat fresh take on a single mom finding new love.",

    "review": "I definitely learned some things, and also didn't. We keep on hearing the same story over and over again. The economy seems to keep lurching from crisis to crisis, and people throw up their hands every time there's a collapse of sorts and then private equity shows up and buys up everything, and the cycle of wealth accumulation goes basically unchallenged. Rinse, repeat. I don't really think it's that hard to imagine a solution. Politically, it shouldn't even be that hard. The elites make it seem like the solutions are untenable, but they distort the narrative significantly.I have been reading a book about the Koch brothers, and I can say with absolute certainty: do not trust ANYTHING they say. I say to my family, when Eminem even acknowledges the very existence of mumble rappers, it gives them more power. It's the same with the 'mainstream news' media. If you even accept the very idea that someone's views on an opposing channel are worth debating, you have implicitly bought into the idea that they even have merit in the first place. So it's simple: don't accept the narratives of the elites. They live in a complete bubble and think the entire universe revolves around them, and they are absolutely myopic because they only hear each others' opinions and live in separate zip codes. I once heard, \"To be rich in America means never having to be around people who aren't.\" So don't even accept any of the premises they are arguing from.We need to have a reckoning. Don't accept the status quo.",

    "review": "'WHEELMAN': Four Stars (Out of Five)An action flick about a getaway driver that's in a race to survive after he's double-crossed during a bank robbery. It stars Frank Grillo in the title role, and it costars Garret Dillahunt, Caitlin Carmichael, Wendy Moniz, Shea Whigham and Slaine. Jeremy Rush made his feature filmmaker debut writing and directing the movie. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it was released on Netflix through their streaming site. I really enjoyed it. Grillo plays a getaway driver that goes only by wheelman. During a bank robbery he gets a call from a mysterious unknown caller. The caller then threatens him and tells him to leave the two robbers behind. So once the stolen money is in his trunk, the wheelman takes off as he was told to do. Realizing he's in a lot of trouble, and his family is in danger, the wheelman struggles to figure out who double-crossed him, as he desperately tries to make sure no harm is done to him or his loved ones. The movie is extremely intense and surprisingly (oddly) claustrophobic; as most of the film takes place inside of a car. It's really suspenseful as well, and it comes to a pretty satisfying conclusion (I think). The car chases and action scenes are all good, and pretty violent, but the film is surprisingly not that full of them. It's mostly just Frank Grillo, acting his ass off. The guy is an incredibly talented, and very charismatic, leading man action hero. In my opinion he makes the whole movie work. This rookie filmmaker, Jeremy Rush, also does a pretty impressive job too though. Netflix can do no wrong right now, almost, for me.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/eoAny_TuUM4",

Despite that, this documentary was fascinating -- the ability to con the best collectors, and the FBI's attempts to track down the con man.

The acting is much better than any Japanese movie where they tend to overact all the time. I wouldn't score this movie high for the acting but for the story itself, which is entertaining to follow and with a good mystery feeling. So once again I'm impressed by the Korean movie makers, clearly the best out of Asia.",

On top of that, an \"investors\" will also receive good income if they do the marketing by recruiting new \"victims\".The module of the business is taking money from those newcomers at the bottom of the pyramid and pay those on top. Such schemes have been going on in Asia, especially in Malaysia, and I have personally heard of one in Korea 8 or 9 years ago. The movie did not go into details of how the scam works but they show the event, seminar and what the scam CEO said to their members and workers are very realistic. There is enough action and excitement in the movie and all the 3 actors did well, everyone with a different character and body language. I give it a 8 and I encourage everyone to watch it so that they don't get scammed by such a scheme !",

I know the makers face some serious protest and faced strong opposition from both Hindu and Muslim leaders. This is normal and nowadays this is a common thing for any Indian political drama film. there are multiple PILs filed to protest the film and the makers face serious problem about this. But after all this haphazard situation the movie came and released all over the India. I am not sure about the screen numbers but as far I know the film released all over the India. The movie tells the story of 2013 Hindu-Muslim Muzaffarnagar riots and a very strong political reason worked behind this riots. The movie is all about the political situation of that issue. When the sensitive political issues are the concern you have to maintain a fast pace and you have clear and clarify all the situation. You have to mention each and every side of the situation. there is no abstract theme and you have to cleanse the issues properly. The director completely fails to create the enlargement of the story. the second problem is the screenplay. This is a very predictable and certain screenplay which is also the cause of slow pace. performance wise Ashutosh Rana shines for his role And Jimmy Shergill has also done a good job for his role. Narendra Jha is also a good actor and he has done a fair job for his role. Other technical aspects are not up to the mark.If you are very curious about the mentioned political issues and there are nothing movie spare for you then you can choose this.",

Comedy is one of my favorite genre and all the main actors did well in this movie i have seen worst and this is far from worst that i have seen.(Morgan Taylor Campbell) plays Sadie Mitchell a teenager who create a list of things she want to do before the world ends in 31 days. Sadie is showing many signs of paranoia with anxiety or fear. I can't fully relate to Sadie but i seen a lot of people who go through anxiety or a state of under pressure fear of dying, losing someone close or enter and leaving high school and other things. I myself always avoid and not worry so much into things like that with Sadie she's prepared and more cautious by surrounding herself with food supplies all kept storage in her bunker.Everyone look at Sadie as this insane person but one person (Jack Diaz) portray by Ricardo Hoyos Sadie's crush. It just proves everyone have different ways of dealing with their own problems in high school.Yes Sadie's parents did seem unaware or just didn't bother to care so much about their daughter having these anxiety but that's the comedy side. There were some parts that was funny and some parts for you to know to take serious. This movie is listed as comedy and i enjoyed it just for that reason.I like how Sadie kept giving out early Christmas present as apart of her anxiety of the world will end.Sadie's friend Brennan portray by (Clark Backo) want to live her life and not worry so much by getting through high school. Brennan is also the most important person to Sadie on her list.I felt like Sadie's last day on earth show a side of people like Sadie with anxiety very well.

I ended up watching an few episodes again, and as an educator now, definitely see the value in this show! Is it perfect? No. But I absolutely wish they had continued the show.

    "plot": "Features Rocco's Perfect Slaves 9 (2016)",
    "review": "The documentary \"Rocco\" opens with a close up of Rocco Siffredi's penis. It's an obvious place to start, but it also serves as a summation the entire documentary. No matter how many opportunities directors Thierry Demaizi\u00e8re and Alban Teurlai give the aging porn star to bare his soul, he usually ends up just showing his d--- instead, metaphorically if not always literally.But Rocco's penis has served him well. His IMDb page lists over 500 \"acting credits,\" dating back to 1986, including a few legit gigs, such as Catherine Breillat's \"Anatomy of Hell\" and the Italian comedy \"Matrimonia a Parigi\" (\"Rocco\" the documentary makes no mention of these forays into \"real\" movies). It's afforded him fame and fortune, far more than most performers in the adult industry can claim, and for far longer, too. Only Ron Jeremy's career is (ahem) longer, dating back to the late '70s. Yet Rocco, in much better shape in his 50s than Jeremy was in his 30s, thinks it's time to retire from performing. He cites concerns for his teen-age sons, who know what their father does for a living but are, as presented in the documentary, shielded from seeing their father in action. (Their mother, Rosa Caracciolo, was also once a porn star, another detail this documentary makes no mention of.) Mostly, though, he's just tired. To hear him tell it, having a generous endowment and hyperactive sex drive is as much a curse as a blessing. In fact, Rocco pretty much portrays himself as a sex addict, barely able to interact with women outside of sex. Even when grieving the death of his beloved mother Rocco is unable to keep his desires in check: he tells of an encounter with a friend of his mother after his mother's funeral, when he takes out his moneymaker and coerces the woman--a senior citizen, mind you--to fellate him. The story is simultaneously outrageous (it sounds like a scene out of an '70s-era French sex comedy) and unsettling. He's telling the story to illustrate how he's a helpless slave to sex, blithely ignoring that, as he's told it, he forced an old woman to give him a BJ.There are more graphic examples of Rocco's uneasy relations with women in the industry. At his Budapest-based porn production company, he's charming and even fatherly when chatting with his female performers before putting them in an uncomfortably rough group-sex scene, the kind that leaves women with rug burns on their backsides. (The only sex shown in this movie is of the rough variety.) He's equally charming in Los Angeles when meeting scene partner Abella Danger, then takes her up on an offer to demonstrate her ability to swallow his entire hand. Danger may not be doing anything against her will, but that doesn't make it any easier to watch her, gagging and with tears streaming down her face, as Rocco pushes his entire hand into her mouth.The co-star Rocco chooses for his final scene is English porn star Kelly Stafford, much to the dismay of his hot-headed cousin and business partner, director Gabriel \"Gabby\" Galetta, who makes his dislike of the outspoken Stafford plain. One gets the idea that the fact that Stafford speaks at all is an issue in Galetta's eyes. Stafford is a handful, but I liked her for being a confident woman who won't do anything with which she'd be uncomfortable. In other words, she's not the type to let a man shove his hand down her throat just to prove she's compliant.Though \"Rocco\" has its moments of levity, like a shot of naked male performers standing outside for a smoke break between takes, or the perplexed faces of crew members at Kink.com's studios, where Rocco's supposed final scene is being shot, as they listen to Galetta's confusing directions, they are overshadowed by the more depressing aspects of porn the documentary inadvertently exposes. Turns out enacting people's sexual fantasies is as dehumanizing and grueling as working on a factory assembly line. As for Rocco himself, he's personable if a little self-absorbed, not nearly as introspective or sensitive as he'd like us to believe, and his treatment of women is just a tad bit rape-y. Mostly, though, he's a guy who has a big penis.",

But that doesn't stop him having decent success in quite a few movies in recent years. Also while I'm not sure if he's big in Japan (tonight), I do know he's big in Germany.But even over here this particular movie will have some issues. Or rather limited success to be more specific. While the movie does try to give the whole thing a slightly different taste with its story it doesn't work that well overall. Also the action scenes are not the best he's done, stunt wise that is. If you're a fan of his work, this may be worth a look, but everyone else should probably spend their time otherwise",

This helps him find creative ways to stop the bad guy in each episode while also helping build his own confidence in his own life. Doesn't that sound like a show you should be watching? Well unfortunately that's not the show I got. Instead it's about a narcissistic superhero who turns into a puppet and when his owner puts him on his hand, they gain superpowers and fight bad guys. All the while he deals with the same tired tropes I've seen done to death. A moronic Dad, a mean teacher, a secret identity from his parents, his best \"friend\", getting sick and so on. Credit where credit is due, the animation is really good. It so fluid and lively, especially during the action scenes. The character design is also pretty good, the characters emote well enough, their bodies match with their personality and the colors are bright and pretty. Overall though, this show is not just bad, but frustratingly bad because it could've been so much better.",

It started off with a bang and kept you engaged throughout. The acting was passable for sustaining the action and the story, no one stood out negatively. The story was intriguing, genuinely spooky and it had a good pace to it. You understood exactly as much as they wanted you to understand while keeping you almost entirely in the dark until they wanted to let you in.Unfortunately, this is where it started to fall apart. While the twist was certainly unoriginal and most definitely something you've seen before, on paper, said twist had a slight extra twist to it that could have made it passable... but the execution made it feel so silly and cliche. With almost no tact or finesses they were just like \"guess what, here is the twist\" and it really felt rushed and underdeveloped. Also, I don't know if they decided to change the script after filming or someone screwed up or what, but there is a scene towards the end with some GNARLY ADR... idk what they were trying to cover up but woof... Not to mention the very last scene is a tad unfulfilling as well.Now, personally, I would not let that deter you as I still really enjoyed this for what it was. Im a little surprised by all the scathing reviews. While it wasn't perfect and the ending was eye-roll worthy, it was still quite entertaining and creepy. I'm giving this a 6.5 rounding down to a 6.

    "plot": "The filming locations and production design of the interviews, with brick walls and industrial equipment, represent labor that, according to DuVernay, \"has been stolen from black people in this country for centuries.\"",
    "review": "It appears that all reviews of this documentary are in turn reviewed by where people stand politically. I'll side-step that by analyzing this as a film lover who is multi-ethnic and has studied criminology and has worked for many years in the behavioral health system, including rehabilitation and diversion of people entering the judicial system, of all races and social classes. And so it goes...\"13th\" or \"The 13th\" does well in cinematic sense with an interesting photography of the subjects it interviews, and very effective editing. Its juxtapositions of past and present work well for film purposes, although some may object to the sociopolitical comparisons. What was ineffective and annoying was the use of sudden words quite often going into the screen, including the occasional song lyric, not all of which felt like it matched. It often felt like it was there to pad time, which is odd given the wide range of subjects that were interviewed who likely had more to say. That stole from the experience for me, akin to complaints that I've read others make of other documentaries that have done this, e.g. \"Nico Icon\". As a whole, the narrative starts off potent but loses some traction about 2/3rds through, similar to how I felt about DuVernay's \"Selma\".From the criminal justice and political aspect, \"13th\" does best when it sticks to its thesis: that politicians created a system of mass incarceration for dubious reasons, which are rooted in racism and intentional disenfranchisement, and which is possibly influenced by businesses that make a profit from running prisons and using prisoners as a cheap or free workforce. Yes, it is a long run-on sentence, but that's the thesis. It supports itself well when analyzing politics, and the intentional and unintentional consequences. It alternates between stating one side of a debate as fact (e.g. whether Woodrow Wilson endorsed \"Birth of a Nation\") and having people who represent both sides of the debate. Regardless, it achieves its effect of a plausible theory, while eliciting horror, anger, and disgust. It is less well supported when exploring the link of current companies that stand to gain from imprisonment. They clearly document that they lobby to expand their business opportunities, including some highly questionable attempts and an inappropriate role in writing laws, but it's less clear that they are a driving force behind the incarcerations. It doesn't help when they use some gross generalizations, e.g. that Aramark sells rotten food. I've seen Aramark serve their generic, fattening cafeteria food to dozens of institutions, and it is never rotten, as in those two awful instances. However, DuVernay does raise an effective alert of a potential threat, that at the very least leaves us questioning the role of commercialization/privatization of the criminal justice system.She is less successful when she goes off course into tying in Black Lives Matter; it didn't really fit the main narrative, but more of a sub-narrative of law and order being altered by racism. This deserves a larger, longer, more careful focus, as it brings in much debated situations that are too recent, some brought in too briefly. \"OJ: Made in America\" addresses this sub-topic better, using a greater length.But as much as DuVernay puts into the film to explore how incarcerations increased, she misses many factors. Racism, explosion in population in the post-war era, political machinations, and introduction of drugs and drug laws are all mentioned. She somehow leaves out the increase in availability in firearms, the development of gangs (ironic, as the Bloods and the Mara Salvatrucha started in US prisons), and a sharp increase in a pro-crime, narcissistic sub-cultures. This is not limited to one racial/ethnic group or socioeconomic group, nor is it recent. But 90s-on gangsta culture has driven in hard a message that life is short; you need to blow massive amounts of money in narcissistic displays of it; that decent jobs will not get you there, that stealing, dealing, grifting and boosting are the only ways; that going to prison is good and inevitable; and that the slightest challenge to your being the center of the universe should be responded to with violence. This culture, when it is bought into by anyone of any group, is the hardest thing to deal with when trying to rehabilitate someone, second only to an abusive family. And I've seen it with white kids from wealthy families, 2nd generation Latinos with hardworking parents with different values and culture, African-American kids with extremely hardworking parents who reject this message, and adults who should know much better. And it is now being exported overseas, with the same result of increased incarceration and police violence. Why skip this? Why not question it as well? DuVernay's thesis suggests that almost everyone in the criminal justice system are only there because of petty drug charges, but she fails to test the null hypothesis. While this is true of a segment of prisoners, it does not apply to all. I bring it up because more than half of felons and people otherwise with repeat criminal justice involvement that I have encountered (of all races) have charges for multiple crimes; it is not just simple possession, or dealing small amounts of lesser drugs, but additional crimes such as those around theft, sudden acts of aggression, forgery, or driving while intoxicated. Are African Americans more exposed to drug crime in general, due to the same factors she lists? And what are the alternatives to incarceration? DuVernay also regrettably skips probing rehabilitation and probation, other than to briefly question the latter as over-done and possibly driven by profit.In sum, good for discussion of political issues, but not comprehensive in criminology issues.",

Again though, it was a bit hard to follow at times but even so it kept my attention from start-to-finish and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",

My book is my book, your picture, were you to make it, is your picture. Your movie maker's fidelity to my novel is of no great concern to me. Establish your own values, means, goal. Leave the book behind so it doesn't get in the way.\"",
    "review": "This movie is being described as \"A boy witnesses his parents' marriage falling apart after his mother finds another man.\" And while I think thats true, I think its a bit more complex than that. It also is a bit of a coming of age story where Joe has to grow up and be the adult in this family, but also it seems that mom is having a mid-life crisis (although shes not quite mid-life) and trying to discover who she is outside of being the \"perfect 50s housewife\" that perhaps she feels trapped in. There's a lot of symbolism in this movie. The backdrop of this movie is that there is a wildfire that has been raging and the townspeople have been desperately trying to put out. And that correlates with Joe and his own family. Hes trying to put out the fire in his own family. Also, Joe works at photography studio and Paul Dano (the director and co-writer) even said that this is supposed to be a PORTRAIT of a family life. Speaking of Paul Dano, I think he did well with his directorial debut. I think visually there are some gorgeous shots in this movie. Like for instance where Joe is watching the wildfires (and hes perfectly centered - probably again to mimic the portrait vibe). Also where Joe is about to give up but it starts to snow and hope has regained. I liked the film for the most part. They do frame the film by following Joe's perspective. And I think its mostly effective in making you feel for this kid, my only problem is there are a couple of parts where I feel like there are gaps in the story. Without giving too much away there is a scene where Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal) has decided to seek revenge and it ends up backfiring. And yet, the next time we see him everything seems to be fine. And it never really gets explained what happened. Theres a brief line that they decided it was a \"misunderstanding\" but you never really see what happened and he also gets hurt during this, and that never gets brought up again either. I know Paul and Zoe (the other writer) were adapting this from a book and perhaps thats the way it is in there too. But I personally found that a little frustrating. I needed a little more. Carey Mulligan is fantastic in this. She would be deserving to have her name thrown in the hat for awards season. I also thought Ed Oxenbould was a standout too. Which is good to hear since he's onscreen for pretty much most of the movie. I definitely will be looking forward to more of his things. I also thought Jake Gyllenhaal was good but hes absent for a good chunk of the film and so he just didnt stand out as much as Carey or Ed did.Overall I liked the film. It wasn't perfect, but I would totally check out another film that Paul Dano directs.",

O'Toole completely separates Sands actions from the political context of the time. Sands was in prison for a second time for IRA activities. He had joined the IRA in 1971, having grown up in a time of violence, discrimination and oppression of catholic people in the 6 counties. This is the context behind Bobby Sands' actions but it is barely mentioned.The violence perpetrated by loyalists and the British army, against nationalists is never mentioned in this film. Only violence by the IRA is mentioned. The film even mentions the upsurge in violence in 1972, without mentioning the biggest reason for it, Bloody Sunday which occurred in January of that year.And therein lies the biggest problem with this film. It is determined to present a very one-sided picture of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, where the IRA were the sole aggressors and everyone else, including the British were victims. At the same time, Bobby Sands is separated from the historical context by the constant positing of him as some kind of artist. The film disrespects Bobby Sands and all the hunger strikers by removing their actions from the political context of the time.And while some of the animated sequences are well done, the editing is poor. Scenes are juxtaposed together which jar against each other. Thus the film doesn't flow very well and can be hard to watch, while certain scenes are unnecessarily repeated.Ultimately, the film is revisionist propaganda, serving a particular political line.

Gibson and Safinia eventually left the project, with a new director and a new screenwriter (Todd Komarnicki) taking over.

Produced by and also starring Mel Gibson - who was also great in his role, this film was directed exceptionally well, and the writing was good. I felt the screenplay was all over the place in a few areas, and the 124 min length a little too long for the story being told. I'm not a fan of slow paced films, but this one was just right. Casting was great, including Game of Thrones' Natalie Dormer, but wow did Sean Penn give an Oscar-worthy performance in his role as Dr. Minor. Glad to see him back on the big screen. The score was perfect and the sets/costumes on point for the era.This is by no means an action packed Hollywood blockbuster, but instead a historical biopic produced extremely well, and a must-see.A well deserved 9/10 from me.",

    "review": "Apparently the director had a falling out w Sunny over the film,so i was expecting something at least mildly interesting, and it was. It was quite slow at times though so i cant rate it too highly, and it honestly just made me feel bad for the woman known as Sunny Leone as she comes across as much less intelligent that i thought, as she appears to be just another dumb girl from porn trying to cash in on her 15 minutes of fame,however she can. Most of the things she talks about is how she is able to make money and did porn to make money and she rarely says anything intelligent. After seeing the film I honestly feel kind of sorry that her life seems that empty and that there is nothing.. behind the facade. I do not think whatever fame she has will last much longer as she is pretty much just a good looking girl who is good at dancing, who happened to do porn,and happens to be from India at a time when they are just realizing what internet porn is. Beyond that she shows no actual talent or intelligence so i will say the film was decently interesting to see the veil lifted a bit and see how banal this persons life is. (She does seem like a nice person however, but.. acting is probably not her thing.). This is probably why she did not like the films true portrayal of her...as there isn't much of anything beyond the facade.",

Knox appealed; the American press took up her case, ridiculing Italian justice and making a defence of the investigation, ironically, a point of patriotism for some Italians. In the end, Knox was exonnerated, and if this documentary is to be believed, this was the correct verdict. The film features a self-incriminating interview with muck-raking journalist Nick Pisa, a man who seems utterly unwilling to accept that his job carries any level of moral responsibility.

    "review": "In recent years, out of the studios of Hong Kong cinema comes an unlikely movie franchise that doesn't involve gangsters, martial arts and ultra-violence. In a cinematic landscape indundated by super action movies franchises from the world's studios vying for our attention, Love Off the Cuff is a breath of fresh air.Love in a Puff (2010) introduced us to an unlikely pair \u2013 Jimmy, a man-child working in advertising and Cherie, an older woman in the cosmetic industry. The movie has a distinctive indie vibe and is a marvellous reflection of a time when smoking is prohibited in many opened areas in Hong Kong and the couple had their \"meet cute\" in the back alley together with other chainsmokers.Director Pang Ho Cheung thought their story has run its course, but someone actually created the email address fleetingly mentioned in the movie and it was flooded with emails from fans of the movie. Two years later, Love in the Buff (2012) dropped and in not so many words this movie has become one of my \"lexicon of love\" films. Cherie and Jimmy are practically old friends to me and my wifey, and we are so glad there are more stories to be told.In this third chapter Love Off the Cuff (2017), we find Cherie (Miriam Yeung) and Jimmy (Shawn Yue) back from their Beijing work stint and have settled down into a routine with their relationship in a comfortable rut. Jimmy's \"godmother\" (Jiang Meng Jie) and Cherie's estranged father (Paul Chun Pui) with his young fianc\u00e9 Apple (Wang Xiao Chen) come into their lives, and their couplehood is again fraught with tension and is threatened. The path to finding the answer will be filled with laughter and tears.The movie opens with a fan-nod with a yet again uncontiguous scene that will make you wonder whether you have walked into the wrong cinema. I like the opening horror scene because it subtly paints Cherie's relationship insecurities, personified by a Gat Gat Gang, a huge monster which eats children. This ridiculous-looking Monster bookends the film in a fitting manner. Like the previous installments, there are cameos galore but I wished the filmmakers have chosen household names that I would know. Nothing beats getting Ekin Cheng playing himself as Cherie's boyfriend in Love in the Buff. This being the third outing, the movie slips easily into comedy territory because of our familiarity with the characters. The first gag is a raunchy one which recalls a policeman from the first movie.This being the third entry in a rom-com genre is a minor miracle in itself. However, it is very difficult for lightning to strike the same spot a third time. The stakes are much lower because you know that no matter what they will come back together. The plot moves in a predictable manner without much narrative propulsion. The first two acts feel like a cross- stitch of situation comedy gags. We laughed but the narrative wasn't compelling, but thankfully every disparate part comes together in the last act in a satisfying manner. Get ready for some major Yatterman nostalgia. The movie also feels like a reflection of the changing social mores and landscape in Hong Kong. In the end, it is our love for the characters that draws a line from our heart to the couple's. I have seen Miriam Yeung and Shawn Yue in other movies, but nothing they have been in is comparable to their roles here. Their chemistry is palpable and lived-in.Judging from the four (or was it three?) hilarious end-credit sequences, the franchise may not be in its last legs yet, but I hope Pang has closed the chapter on Cherie's insecurities and Jimmy's roving heart, and will take them to new places. Sigh\u0085 writing this review made me miss them already\u0085 \"n 55!w !\"",

    "plot": "At about 1:30, footage of the LM ascent module is shown lifting off from the moon. This was the final Apollo mission, Apollo 17, which left the moon on December 14, 1972. This is a remarkable shot, as the camera was being controlled remotely from Houston, and powered by the lunar rover and with the transmission being beamed from the rover's antenna. As it takes approximately one and a half seconds for a radio signal to travel from the earth to the moon and another second and a half for the return signal, controller Ed Fendell had to start the camera moving a second and a half before the actual blast off. He then used the joystick to tilt the camera upwards at the same rate as the ascent of the spacecraft, but anticipate its location from moment to moment and do it one and a half seconds early. Thanks to his precise timing, he was able to capture the shot while keeping the spacecraft in the frame the entire time.",
    "review": "As far as I'm aware there has not been a film produced and dedicated to the genuine unsung heroes of Mission Control who shined so spectacularly during the transcendent era of NASA first landing men on the moon. And my question is.......Why the hell NOT?! Well, the good news is that thanks to British Director and expert Editor David Fairhead now there FINALLY is at last a fitting tribute to the extraordinary pioneers who were so crucially instrumental in rocketing The United States to victory in \"The Space Race\" of the 1960's and '70's. For we now have the stunning new documentary \"Mission Control: The Unsung Heroes of Apollo\". And, man, I'm here to tell ya it is worth the wait! Fairhead has done a resolutely masterful job of chronicling the birth and next-to-impossible meteoric emergence of NASA in the wake of the Russians successfully blasting Sputnik 1 into Earth orbit in 1957. Through a riveting series of actual footage and news reports of the period seamlessly interwoven with jaw-dropping outer spacecraft flight recreation and interviews with representatives of the engineering team who integrated peerlessly to transform dreams into unparalleled achievement, Fairhead fashions a narrative that is as rousing and thrilling as it is richly informative and educational.For my money, the highlight of \"Mission Control\" are the interviews Fairhead conducted and intersperses throughout his remarkable production with the men who made it all happen both in our world as well as in the vast heavens above. The ambitious filmmaker secured riveting and revealing chats with the iconic likes of US Space Program leaders Chris Craft and Gene Kranz together with legendary astronauts Jim Lovell and the late Gene Cernan. And while the remarks and observations of these larger-than-life figures resonate profoundly, it is the words of the lesser known members of this steadfastly committed crew that really struck most poignantly. You see my own dad, Olav Smistad, worked with these gentlemen and knows most of them personally. And while his involvement with the Mission Control unit was cursory during the Gemini Program, his experience as a gifted and talented aerospace engineer and true pro with NASA mirrors exactly the unfaltering can-do sensibility of the exceptional guys featured in the film.Certainly I am bias. Yes, I am resoundingly pro-American Space Program. Sure I believe in the immensely talented and enthusiastic men and now the women (of whom there were none to speak of on the front lines of NASA in it's infancy) of the agency who are accomplishing so much, but who could realize so much more with the backing of their government, which was powerfully and consistently supportive in the formative and solidifying years of the national space exploration initiative. Now if we want to travel into space we have to hitch a ride with Russia.It should NEVER be this way.May \"Mission Control: The Heroes of Apollo\" uniformly inspire those with whom we have invested our votes, and our collective faith, into to lead this great country in facing head-on such harsh truth with thoughtful and productive comportment. In other words, DO something. And act in a manner that befits, and serves to honor, those humble heroes who were cheered on by citizens both at home and abroad every single step of the way toward and including those awe-inspiring, deeply moving moments when man wondrously walked on the moon. For there are still so many gloriously giant leaps for mankind to negotiate.Now and forever.",

    "review": "As \"The Women's Balcony\" (2016 release from Israel; 96 min.) opens, we see a group of people gathering at an Orthodox synagogue, to celebrate a Bar Mitzvah. The women participate from the synagogue's balcony, and the unthinkable happens: the balcony crashes, causing a major injury to the Rabbi's wife and causing the Rabbi to hole up in his house. The congregation needs an interim house of prayer and Rabbi. By happenstance, Rabbi David, an ultra-Orthodox, offers his services and the congregation eagerly accepts. However, it's not long before major tensions arise between Rabbi David and the synagogue's women. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: there have been quite a few movies that have examined the ultra-Orthodox communities, both here in the US and in Israel. However, this movie takes a different approach and examines the tensions between an Orthodox congregation and an ultra-Orthodox rabbi. However, it is done in a respectful way, and with the necessary wink and a smile. That said, I would not categorize this movie as a \"comedy\" as IMDb is doing. Once the movie's premise is fully made clear, it's a fairly predictable road from there to how it all plays out, but that didn't stop me from enjoying these characters. Israeli actor Aviv Alush brings his role as Rabbi David with authority. The photography (entirely in Jerusalem) is very pleasing tot the eye.\"The Women's Balcony\" opened recently at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Sunday matin\u00e9e screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. If you are in the mood for a decent foreign movie that looks at tensions between the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox, you could do worse than checking out \"The Wedding Balcony\", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",

I will now rewrite my review and simply present the facts, whilst trying not to sound overly hate-filled. Here we go.'One of Us' is flawed in many areas. The biggest one would have to be the acting. The acting is bad from almost the entire cast, however the most important role they got wrong was that of 'Brent' played by Derek Smith. This role really needed someone with some genuine charisma to sell the story that they are trying to tell. Smith simply didn't have it sadly.The next flaw lies in the dialogue the actors have to work with. It's not written well. It's clunky and unnatural almost throughout the entire film. They just needed someone to come in with some expertise and strengthen the script up a bit.The final problem lies in the blandness of the whole experience. I've seen children's movies with more violence than this film gets away with. Anything that does happen is off screen. Were the sensors on them that heavily that they felt this was necessary, or was this an creative decision on the director's part? Either way it makes for a very dull experience.It's tough to find any positives worth mentioning for 'One of Us'. It's not a film that I could recommend spending your time or money on.",

In the meantime, she meets another man who recently divorced. Her lifestyle, best friend, all things that's happening around her revealed with some fun. The film was not that great, but surely not a boring film. The dream/imagination sequences spoiled my watch. Because it only brought a false hope. I thought those scenes were better than how the real story progressed. That says, sometimes cliches are okay than being plain. It did not work, but I still suggest to go for it if you are interested.

The Doll (2016) is one of those cheesy creation by Indonesian that finally caught my full attention in the last 10 mins (at least) after the appearance of Sara Wijayanto, tbh. I decided to grasp the entire lame conversation and plot in the first 20 mins but still can't help dozing off because its raw execution of scenarios, irrational bridging, or even the poor roles. So, I jumped the cursor to the last 20 mins and finally, a fruitful stories to witness.I usually don't count the stars I gave to rate a film but as a proud Indonesian, I felt obliged to address my reviews for a better execution of horror movies in the future, especially in collaboration with the best production house and movie stars like this one.1st star = for the actors choice and location\n2nd star = for the adopted and adapted scenes from conjuring series. Yes it was smooth anyways, but I love horror genres and conjuring universe is one of a hail series deserved to re-watch, thus I recognized \"that\" parts you used and re-created\n3rd star = for the special effects and logical impact during the thrilling scenes only\n4th star = for a light moral value by Mrs. Sara as usual. I love DMS, might this be a biased comment but her narratives were virtuous for us who still alive.I previously planned to watch the 2nd sequel, The Doll 2, but seeing the first one was kinda like this, I might re-think first.",

Milo Gibson's acting was too stale, as the majority of his lines were too monotonic and he seem asleep throughout most of his dialogue. His fight scenes however, were on point. For me, the only three stand-out lead actors were William Fichtner (too bad only a mall role - haven't seen him do much lately), Joseph Millson, and Gbenga Akinnagbe killed it (well, compared to the rest). And enjoyable film to see if you're craving action and nothing else to watch on a Sunday afternoon, but nothing memorable. It's a 6/10 from me.",

    "review": "\"S.W.A.T.: Under Siege\" should delete its writer's credit and replace it with a line crediting everybody who has written an action film in the past. The plot draws heavily from \"Assault on Precinct 13\" and \"Safe House,\" with a lot of familiar tropes seen in dozens of genre films. What few mild surprises the plot offers generally happen off-screen, although it is not easy to predict which characters will die, who will kill whom and the order of their demises. The biggest surprise seems borrowed from \"Showdown in Little Tokyo\" and is surprising only because the film hadn't yet developed the characters \u2013 although, to their credit, it is a great improvement on the SILT scene. The bad guys who are really good and the good guys who are really bad could have simply worn T- shirts identifying themselves. The dialogue alternates between pretentious, execrable, familiar and unnecessary. Production values are generally adequate, although marred by over-reliance on distracting jiggly-cam shots. However, the fight scenes are capably executed. Michael Jai White is highly proficient and other cast members demonstrate considerable skill as well, including Marsden, Zagorsky, Jaeger and Palicki. The fight choreography is competent, although uninspired. The special effects incorporated into the numerous gun battles are handled well. Advocates of diversity in films should be encouraged by the ethnically diverse cast. However, skeptics will note that most of the Asian, Hispanic and black performers are in background roles and underutilized. The director seems to have attempted to give a couple of them more screen time with prolonged noble demises, but the shots seem more distracting than empowering. White delivers his dialogue with a heavy accent and another character is given an urban 'tude, but as in many films with large casts, the diversity seems more a result of casting decisions than screen writing choices.",

    "review": "Just when you've come to hate him more than love him for truly frustrating duds such as 'From Vegas to Macau 3' and 'Mission Milano', Hong Kong's most prolific filmmaker Wong Jing compels you to take him seriously once again with the best gangster drama we've seen in a long while.Written, produced and co-directed by Wong Jing, his latest period epic charts the rise and fall of two of Hong Kong's most infamous real- life characters from the 60s and 70s \u2013 the one-time most powerful drug lord in Hong Kong Ng Sik-ho (or better known as 'Crippled Ho') and the notoriously corrupt detective Lui Lok (or otherwise known as 'Lee Rock'). Perhaps because he had already previously told Lee Rock's story, Wong Jing anchors this movie around Sik-ho (Donnie Yen), who first steps foot in Hong Kong in 1960 as an illegal immigrant from Chaozhou with his three buddies (Philip Keung, Wilfred Lau and Kang Yu) and younger brother Peter (Jonathan Lee). Although engaged in odd jobs, the quartet find more lucrative means of employment by being paid to make up the numbers in street fights. One such fight is that purportedly between rivalling triad heads Comic (Jason Wong) and Grizzly Bear (Ricky Yi). Unfortunately, the fight turns ugly with the arrival of the riot police led by the British Superintendent Hunter (Bryan Larkin), and before the night is over, Sik-ho ends up in a run-in with the arrogant and supercilious 'gwei-lo'.All that is witnessed by Lee Rock (Andy Lau) and his right-hand man Piggy (Kent Cheng), who spies Sik-ho's superior fighting skills and decides to recruit him and his buddies while they are in lock-up. As circumstances would have it, in order to save one of his buddies caught stealing from mafia boss Bro Chubby (Ben Ng), Sik-ho will end up working too for the former, running his drug business within the legendary Kowloon Walled City. It is within this hotbed of lawlessness that Lee will venture into one day. Things go south obviously, and the subsequent turn of events binds Sik-ho and Lee in a complex brotherhood embrace \u2013 Sik-ho springs to Lee's rescue but ends up caught in the crosshairs of another parallel ambush sprung by Sir Ngan in collusion with Chubby. In the ensuing scuffle, Chubby breaks Sik-ho's right leg as punishment, thus birthing a hardened and even more driven 'Crippled Ho' upon his discharge from hospital.Sik-ho's transformation comes at the midway point, and it is in the second hour that he truly comes into his own. Not only does he resist Lee's manoeuvres to alter the state of play, Sik-ho takes matters into his own hands against Lee's better advice in order to exact his own vendetta against Superintendent Hunter. There is a lot of plot crammed into a slightly-past-two-hour runtime, but its machinations consistently revolve around the dynamic between Sik-ho and Lee; an especially poignant scene near the end has a visibly embittered Sik- ho pointing out squarely to Lee the personal costs and consequences of the latter's actions over the decade plus on the both of them, and the duo coming to recognise how little of life, death, or anything in between they can truly control.Oh yes, the movie is equal parts plot and character-driven, and Wong Jing's (rare) achievement is how he balances both perfectly to deliver a sprawling but constantly spellbinding account of the fates and fortunes of his two key male protagonists. Due credit also goes to his co-director cum director-of-photography Jason Kwan, who not only brings a vivid cinematic feel to the visuals but also imposes rigour in crafting and building up several pivotal sequences, both of which are too often lost on a frequently sloppy Wong Jing.More prominently, 'Chasing the Dragon' has been sold as a showcase of Donnie Yen's acting chops, and sure enough, Yen doesn't disappoint; in fact, as Sik-ho, Yen probably makes the most significant breakthrough of his career since 'Ip Man'. His portrayal of Sik-ho is understated, nuanced and impressively authentic, especially in depicting his character's transformation from underdog to kingpin. Yen and Lau don't share as many scenes together as we'd have liked, but the duo have great chemistry when they do, embodying the genuine camaraderie between their characters as well as the seeds of distrust, suspicion and resentment sowed by their own respective ambitions, egos and greed. It should also be said that this gangster tale is always careful not to glorify its socially deviant protagonists \u2013 principally for fear of running afoul of Chinese censors \u2013 and is therefore less unhinged than the early 90s flicks of Sik-ho and/or Lee. In fact, Yen and Lau aren't playing so much criminals as they are anti-heroes, so not only are there redeeming qualities about their characters in this movie, both will come in an epilogue set thirty years later to realise and regret the folly of their ways. Yet these politically (and commercially) savvy considerations aside, Wong Jing's latest is still a solid and solidly entertaining example of the genre that is bloody, violent and thrilling.Indeed, there is much to enjoy in this period gangster epic, from the storytelling to the characters to the actors and as well to the richly detailed sets of Tsim Sha Tsui, Wan Chai and Kowloon Walled City. This dragon is one you won't mind chasing from start to finish, and we guarantee you it will leave you on a visceral high.",

Through the discovery of some souvenir records, originally obtained for \"Dave's record collection\" bits on Late Night with David Letterman, Young goes down the rabbit hole of this bizarre world of big-budget corporate one-off musicals. The film begins offering bits and pieces of this strange world as Young's obsession with collecting the rare relics leads him to contacting various players from the world of industrial musicals.Early-on, it becomes clear that Young's appreciation has moved beyond snark into genuine affection. He still finds the music absurd, but he is charmed by It nonetheless. However, for the first half of the film he appears to be on a self-serving, obsessive quest to acquire these records, and the relationships he develops with other collectors he seem to be just a means to that end. Gradually, he begins to meet the players involved in the creation of the musicals: the songwriters and actors, many of whom used these evanescent works as their sole means of support. He, and the film's audience, cannot help but be charmed by these characters and their enthusiasm for what they created. It is only toward the latter third of the film that Young moves from a fairly engaging guide through the history of industrial musicals to a character the audience can root for. He goes from a sort of disaffected comedy nerd to a more evolved and empathetic human being. It's that sub-plot that gives this gem of a documentary it's real heart.",

These girls are pretty, cheerful, energetic and very much conditioned to want to please their fans. While this sounds creepy, and in some ways is creepy, the world of these idols is very controlled - the singers will have \"handshake\" meetings with their fans, for example, but the men are only allowed to shake the girls' hands and there are \"minders\" standing behind the men and forcing them to move from one idol to another after a set number of seconds has passed. So the girls are relatively safe in what could be a very dangerous situation. This film primarily follows Rio, a relative elder in the scene given that she's 19 as the film begins, 21 at the end of it. The filmmaker, Kyoko Miyake, is very gentle with all the characters; even when you think some of these men are terrible, she always treats them with respect and dignity and, in the end, the viewer is more likely to feel sorry for them than anything else (well, except the young man who is only interested in girls around the age of 10 - they \"no longer interest\" him when they get older than that). It's a really interesting glimpse into another Japanese phenomenon, complete with commentary from journalists, sociologists and others who have a stake in the culture; well done.",

    "review": "Whilst perusing Netflix to find an Asian drama, Mad World popped up in my recommendations. Considering mental illness is still rather hush-hush in the east, I didn't have high hopes that Mad World would cover the topic with subtly and honesty. Color me surprised; after spending the last hour and 41 minutes with my eyes glued to the screen, I realized that not only is this one of the best portrayals of mental illness (Bipolar Disorder, specifically) I've ever seen put to film, but Mad World now competes for the best movie I've watched yet this year. How this film isn't more well-known and awarded flabbergasts me.Mad World follows the broken perspective of Tung, a man suffering from Bipolar Disorder in Hong Kong who is released from a mental institution and forced to integrate once more into society and the shattered life he's left behind. We aren't clued in to all the details of Tung's life and unhappiness right away; we know he's depressed, missing his fiancee, and that he has a strained relationship with the father he comes to live with. Further details are lovingly sprinkled throughout the film in heart-wrenching flashbacks with perfect timing; never was I confused about the order of events or the impact they had on Tung's psyche. I come from a family plagued with mental illness; Bipolar Disorder affected both my mother and brother, and contributed to the far too early demise of my brother just last month. The manic/depressive phases of this horrific illness are both laid out here in all their painful, raw glory; the highs are sky-high, and the lows are in the pits of depressive purgatory. It isn't just Tung who suffers; his mother clearly has mental difficulties as well, and the other brother and father have their own realistic ways of dealing with it.The performances here are all stellar. Tung's blank stares of utter hopelessness perfectly mimic those I have seen (and given) time and again when dealing with similar illnesses in my own life. Tung's father's helplessness comes through in many scenes, and his well-meaning but misguided attempts to soothe his adult son are all too realistic to what many of us suffering from depression hear: \"Why can't you just be normal?\" and \"Why are you like this?\" and \"Can't you try to be cheerful?\" The judgements of others play a large role here as well: Tung's fiancee accidentally makes a tense situation worse in a pivotal scene, while leering bystanders see mental illness as a spectacle to jeer.Mad World is not a \"fun\" movie to watch, nor is it heartfelt in the way that most would hope, with everything being fixed at the end and tied up nicely with a neat little bow. Parts of it angered me. Depressed me. Saddened me. But most of all, as someone who has dealt with this personally, it made me feel like I am not alone. Mad World does not sugarcoat the ugly parts of mental illness, whether they are born out of the ill or those who try to support them. It is for this reason that I found it an absolute and ironic breath of fresh air, for it is depressingly beautiful in its candor.Some last minute thoughts: the camerawork was particularly interesting here, aiding the film's dreary atmosphere. For one example, it utilized long shots of the small apartment to make you confront its claustrophobic and cramped nature. The music was perfect: it fit the mood and was used sparingly. The movie felt a bit longer than its runtime, but since every minute was engrossing, I can't fault it for that. Lastly, the characters don't grow much--if at all--during the movie. While this normally would be a flaw, it makes sense for a film about mental illness. Sometimes those affected cannot strive for higher goals--sometimes they just need to learn how to *deal* to make it through the day and get to tomorrow alive. Mad World isn't a film about a man's journey to overcome his mental illness; it's more of a day-in-the-life, where we experience what he goes through for a short time and can only hope for the best for him by the time the credits roll.Mad World is a beautiful film that I recommend to anyone with mental illness, who knows someone with mental illness, or is open-minded enough to try to understand what living with it is like. Make sure you're in the mood to watch it, however, as it's so effective at what it does it might make you feel worse.",

    "review": "As a foreigner I find it always difficult to watch an Asian movie. Even with subtitles, what I am used to. It's because you can't make anything about any word they say. Even if it they would speak about \"McDonald's\" for example you actually would not hear that world out of their mouths. Besides of the linguistic barrier I saw some pretty good Asian movies. This one is full of action, and if I have to be honest the action scenes are really good. The filming of those action shots are of high quality. The story itself isn't bad either but to me it was just a bit too long to stay concentrated for the entire movie. There are a lot of characters, a lot of action and a lot of fast speaking that doesn't do any good to the movie. But it's okay to watch once though. Just for the good action scenes you should give it a try.",

And doing things similar to Mythbusters, without outright plagiarizing it? That's not an easy task.And, for season one, it didn't go too well. If there is to be a second season, it will need some adjustments here and there.The premise? Take a topic (Weirdest weapons of WW II, g-force and it's influence on humans, great escapes, just to give you examples) and pick six items related to it. Six weird weapons for example. Then, find three criteria to judge them by. Each of the three cast members takes two of them and demonstrates them. This can involve building something, like an electric car, it can be documentary footage, play scenes (some good, some bad) or a mix.But - less nerd porn. Slightly more Byron cleavage, though (and a looong sequence of her in underwear). While Mythbusters tried, in a scientific way, to prove or disprove a myth, explaining the science behind it and showing different methods of testing them (with varying success), the White Rabbit Project lacks experimentation. More often than not, you will see experts in their fields and hobbyists demonstrating something. Quite interesting, but as six different aspects of the episode topic need their time, instead of just two or three myths, it lacks depth there.Something is not quite right with the show. Yet. I'd love to see it succeed, though.",

    "review": "Given the recent streak of swing and misses from Marlon Wayans, then I was somewhat hesitant about actually taking the time to sit down to watch this Netflix production. But I still did so, on the off chance that he might actually have struck gold this time.And I must say that I was genuinely surprised with the level of entertainment that \"Naked\" turned out to be. This was definitely one of the better Marlon Wayans movies in quite some time. Now, with that said, I am not saying that this is an outstanding movie in the comedy genre, but it was a definite improvement on his past many movies.I must admit that I found it good to watch Marlon Wayans in a comedy that wasn't a spoof on other movies, so it was something new and refreshing to watch. But then again, the concept of the movie with the same time frame looping over and over, leaving the character in the movie to repeat the same events over and over have been done previously in other movies such as \"Groundhog Day\".The story in \"Naked\" was actually a good combination of comedy and a good story arc, which made for a rather good viewing experience. It was a combination of the storyline, the characters, the events of the story and the dialogue that worked quite well together.Aside from Marlon Wayans, then \"Naked\" does have some good talents on the cast list and some familiar faces if you are no newcomer to comedy. These include Regina Hall, Dennis Haysbert and Loretta Devine.If you enjoy comedies and Marlon Wayans movies in particular, then you should definitely take the time to sit down and watch \"Naked\".",

    "review": "As is my wont, I'm reviewing this against other Asian dramas.It is a nice story about a young nerdy couple in college and their romance. It ties in computer gaming relationships with real-life relationships and that did make it more interesting until that drops by the wayside later in the series. Later in the series the programming company started by the main male character becomes more central to the story.The male protagonist, Xiao Nai (Yang Yang), is an almost perfect character with few flaws. The top-rated character in a game, the best programmer, the top intramural basketball player, the top intramural swimmer and the most handsome guy on campus. It is a lot, especially when I realized he is autistic. I'm kidding a little bit here, but not much. Xiao Nai walks past other people without looking at them, even when they clearly want to talk to him. He often then stops and talks to them without looking at them. In Asian dramas this is somewhat common in the cold, arrogant, rich male and I think I'm going to have to start labeling them all, autistic. Xaio Nai is so perfect that female students treat him as a rock star.He and Bei Wei Wei (Shuang Zheng) do get along well for an Asian drama, with few misunderstandings that are easily corrected with direct communication. Wei Wei is among the top ten players in the game, a good programmer, tallish, thin and attractive.It is a little too stereotypical in that Xiao Nai takes control of the relationship and while Wei Wei may balk at times, she doesn't resist very long. There is more kissy face than I expect in Asian dramas, but my wife liked it. Wei Wei's contributions to work are limited to traditional female inputs such as ordering meals, and suggesting/arranging sleeping cots (but, she is only an intern as she is two years behind Xiao Nai in school).Er Xi (Xiaotong Mao) is a fun character and provides some comic relief, as does Xiao Nai's college roommates and programming buddies.Several of the characters that initially present themselves as bad, for conflict's sake, are allowed to grow and change, which was nice.Overall better than average and fun to watch. Just put aside disbelief at how good Xiao Nai is at so many things (I didn't even mention them all). The main thing I liked about this drama is the two main characters actually trust each other rather than assuming the worst, which is a common conflict in Asian dramas.",

    "review": "Anytime you take a complex story full of iconic moments and try to condense it down to 2 hours, you're just asking for trouble. As someone who read (and enjoyed) the original light novel, I knew up front not to get my expectations too high, but I had still hoped for a bit more than I got. Caricature characters, throwing out glib and rushed lines, a barely coherent storyline (which scarcely resembled the novel) and chaotic action sequences, just for starters. That being said, I blame the director more than the cast, since I did feel the actors could have delivered better performances if they weren't in such a hurry.If this film had any redeeming points at all, it would be the polished cinematography and CG (both were decent, considering the film's budget). Lines aside, the actors also did a reasonable job of acting to green screen, which is notoriously difficult. There were also a handful of scenes overlaying the game world with reality, which were creative and did a surprisingly good job of conveying the feeling of belonging to both the 2-d and 3-d world.ROMANCE RATING: 7/10. As per the novel, there was only one kiss scene, but it was fairly long and the actors had reasonably good chemistry. Bear in mind that while the scene did feature \"A\" door, it is not \"THE\" iconic office door from the novel.In summary, I'm sorry to say this movie was weak in almost every way. Fans of the novel will certainly be disappointed and newcomers are unlikely to develop any interest in the novel. Not recommended. HOWEVER, if you have to choose between this film and the drama, I probably would choose this, mainly because, as others have mentioned, Angela Baby and Boran Jing have acceptable chemistry whereas Yang Yang and Shuang Zheng did not.",

There come a motley group of patients to be treated by a doctor expert on treatments for TOC Trastorno Obsesivo Compulsivo or Obsessive compulsive disorder. They meet at the same time, the reason for a malfunctioning of an office computer run by a secretary. As the misfit patients have been dated the same day.Later on , the secretary informs them that the airplane of the doctor delays from London. Then, one of them suggers share the different obsessions in hoping to heal themselves , as the traumatized patients get together telling their illness, as the personal secrets are disclosed and it results in awry consequences.A fun and really funny comedy blending humor, chuckles , tongue-in-cheek, entertainment, amusement, a lot of laughs and decent performances. A sour comedy developed in marvelous crescendo, ups and down, until a surprising finale, including an enjoyable twist in the screenplay that I will not reveal . It is well acted, and smartly written. The brilliant original idea is expanded throughout the movie in fits and starts. The tone of the picture is light-hearted as well as moving. The actors give a true tour-of-force playing the offbeat roles. These are the following ones : Paco Leon as Emilio, a taxi driver expert on astronomical mathematical calculation and suffering the Diogenes Syndrome, as piling things and hoarding papers . Oscar Martinez as Federico a mature aspiring to advocate a law who says continuous profanities with Tourette syndrome and showing obscene gestures. Alejandra Jimenez as Blanca a lab worker with obsession for cleaning, who suffers mysophobia or panic to bacteria and virus. Rossi De Palma a mature praying, an extremely religious woman often saying prayers, and suffering disorder verification. Adrian Lastra as Otto, a young who doesn't want touch the floor . Nuria Herrero as Lili, a gym trainer affected by Epalilalia, usually repeating phrases, sentences, quotes and repetitive worlds. At the end appears some cameos by notorious actors as Miguel Rellan, Veronica Forque, Marta Hazas, Daniel Grao.It packs a lively and catching musical score by Antonio Escobar . As well as a colorful, adequate cinematography by David Omedes, who has photographed important films such as Salvador, Cowards, The mix, Shacky Carmine, A bench in the park, Pepe Guindo, Perdona si te llamo amor, Wave of crimes, A night in Old Mexico, Dark impulse, Hold up, among others. The motion picture was well directed by Vicente Villanueva. He is a good artisan , writer, producer and filmmaker, who has directed shorts as Eres, Heteroxesuales y casados, and a few films such as Lo contrario al amor and Born to win with Alejandra Jimenez and Victoria Abril , being this TOC TOC his greatest hit.",

Abhinetri is one such film, but surprisingly it is not cheeky like most of its counterparts. The screenplay ensures that we get what we paid for\u0085\u0085entertainment.Krishna Kumar (Prabhudeva) is a 34 year old working in a advertising agency in Mumbai. He is desperate to shed his single status and get married to any girl as long as she is modern and has the right figure. As luck would have it a dying grandmother gets him married to a village girl Devi (Tamannah). Krishna despises Devi and keeps his marriage a secret from his colleagues. One day, he changes his mind and takes her to an award function sponsored by his company and Devi undergoes a dramatic transformation. She becomes a different woman, wears minis, dances, speaks flawless English and flirts around. Back home, she becomes the village girl, wears sari, speaks nothing but telugu and does not remember that she has been out. Krishna soon finds out through his neighbors that an aspiring actress called Ruby killed herself in the very house he is staying. It is clear Devi is possessed by Ruby. Ruby makes a deal with Krishna, he should let her use Devi's body to fulfill her starry ambitions and she would leave him and Devi alone. Krishna reluctantly agrees with a promise that Ruby should leave Devi's body the moment the first film is released\u0085.Ruby agrees, but soon we learn that she has other plans\u0085..Tamannah is spot on with both the characters, she effectively changes her body language for both the characters. The scenes where she threatens Prabhudeva and her dance sequence at the award show showcase her acting abilities which has surprisingly evolved over a decade. A Special mention is the scene where she sees herself for the first time on the screen at the premiere..her expressions speak volumesPrabhudeva is excellent when it comes to comic timing and the mandatory item song with Amy Jackson proves he is still the best of dancing stars around\u0085.even though the quality bar is dipping. Sonu Sood is good, carries off what little is expected of him. Music by Sajid wajid has more of a north flavor even though the film was originally shot in south. The songs are bad, but the music is good.Screenplay and direction by Vijay are excellent and lifts what could have turned into a mundane film to a well executed comic thriller",

    "review": "If you liked \"Deadwood\" you might like \"Damnation.\" Both \"Damnation\" and \"Deadwood\" are about power politics and corruption in western settings, \"Deadwood\" being set in the 19th Century Gilded Age in South Dakota, \"Damnation\" set in rural Iowa during the Great Depression (1931). FYI, the writers and director of \"Damnation\" have worked on projects like \"Longmire\" and \"Office Space.\" The writing is well done (if brutal), and the acting excellent. Filmed in Calgary, Alberta, the scenery passes well enough for some parts of Iowa.One of the differences between the two series is that \"Damnation\" is, while set in the past, deliberately intends to comment on our current state of affairs in the early 21st Century. The 1930's, like our time now, was a time when the economy failed millions, institutions such as the press, law enforcement and the courts appeared to have been corrupted, and the answers to these problems seemed they could only be solved by revolutions either by the extreme right or the extreme left. The comparisons can be taken a little far: one character, representing the \"Big Business\" interests coming after the small farmers, reveals that the interests he represents wants to eventually kick the farmers off their land to not only mechanize agriculture, but also mechanize factories and warfare (I think with our fears of Artificial Intelligence, this is more a fear of our time than the 1930's).Another difference between \"Deadwood\" and \"Damnation\" is that the ruthless business interests are actively being opposed. The farmers are attempting to unionize and strike to protect themselves (though two of the main characters, who are the main labor organizers, would likely really prefer a workers revolution). Also, media like the investigative press and radio may also end up playing part in opposing \"Big Business\" and their enforcers. So far however, the local paper in \"Damnation\" is covering up the attempt to drive the small farmers off their land by price fixing and violence by strikebreakers. The USA Network provides excellent video interviews with the director and writers, who make clear this is their intent. \"To understand the present, go back to the past,\" one of the writers says, or that the series, while set in the 1930's \"Mirrors the Past (director Adam Kane).\" USA also provides a couple of good mini-documentaries \"Legacy of the Heartland: The One Thousand\" and \"Legacy of the Heartland: War of Words.\" The documentaries and the interviews put the characters and the action in better context, and really make this interesting, well thought out series more understandable.",

Reasons that prevent from millions of people to reach their potential. It's an ode to a mother, an ode to a girl child and hopefully a lesson for a lot of people to be more accepting. My Oscar for 2018 goes to this movie, just because it was not just entertainment but also and inspiration.Great natural acting, very minimalistic and simplistic direction, strong message and a inspiration to dream! The movie is a bit longish but it was needed to develop the characters to their full potential. Having said that cutting off 15 minutes would have made it a bit better for international markets as well.Completely recommended for all the people who are looking for a movie to be engrossed in!

    "review": "Pure Flix Entertainment is one the most instantaneously recognizable film companies of our time, mainly in this respect: they really, REALLY want God to be real, and they will assure themselves of this position annually with a flicker show or two. If it also turns out they made a good, subtle, realistic, or even well-argued movie in the process of serving as their own confirmation bias, they just got lucky. In certain ways, I suppose this is one instance.Unlike such Pure Flix productions as God's Not Dead and God's Not Dead 2: We're Still Right, their 2017 piece The Case for Christ is based on a true story, and no, it is not the one with the healed-up lepers. It is about an American atheist and journalist who attempts to disprove the existence of Christ to his very religious wife, only to find that the stuff he learns pushes him more towards the side of faith.Indeed, Lee Stobel is a real person (played here by Mike Vogel of Cloverfield fame) and he did conduct an investigation that ultimately turned him Christian, which he documents in his similarly titled book from 1998. His Wikipedia article is careful to point out that \"The book does not feature any non-evangelical scholarly interviews\", which I think is useful information. Of course he addressed counterarguments in later books, though it seems to have taken place after his brain already finished cooking and his mind was made up - not unlike that which his movie counterpart accuses the wife (Erika Christensen) of.Of course I'm not here to talk about the books themselves, but what they have in common with the film (aside from, y'know, all the content) is that they serve as another bombastic \"told ya so\" for believers. Just because this one atheist done goof'd (his first mistake was seemingly to believe that the burden of proof in the \"Existence of God\" debate was somehow on him), doesn't mean all of us are conversions waiting to happen upon cherry-picked interviews, claims that there were witnesses to Christ's rebirth (without solidly proving THAT), and whatever else passed as research during this journey.I will say this about The Case for Christ: it is the most competently produced \"Christian film\" I've seen to date. The camera work is decent, the music is also enjoyable, and it benefits especially from the fact that it is based on a source material that features sentences that real humans would say. It isn't just sanctimonious preaching interspersed with contrived attempts to make atheists look vile and in-the-wrong next to the enlightened (usually more attractive) Christians.Hell (and please don't give me cancer or starve my family for using that term, Father), it isn't even entirely bogus. The evidence for some sort of \"historical Jesus Christ\" isn't as unconvincing, moot, or flat-out non-existent as the evidence that such a figure existed, came back to life, healed the ill, and somehow looked more like an American hippie than a Middle-Eastern carpenter.There are some solid supporting performances as well, supplied by Faye Dunaway, Mike Pniewski, Robert Forster, Frankie Faison, L. Scott Caldwell, et cetera. But is any of this enough to save a film that is as ill-conceived as the very idea of trying to meet a burden of proof one does not bear? Perhaps it will be for some. I would propose, however, that an exceptional Pure Flix movie does not an exceptional movie make.Furthermore, if you're in the same demographic as blasphemous old me, you'll want something as insipid and unintentionally hilarious as God's Not Dead or A Matter of Faith over generic stuff like this any day. As for those of you who were in some way offended by this review: rest assured that you can pray for my enlightenment whilst I pray that you one day learn how \"extraordinary claims\" work, more reliable ways to study history, and how to operate a light switch.",

    "review": "For those who thought that The Raid 1 & 2 were the last word in kinetic, ultra-brutal martial arts movies, think again: The Night Comes For Us, from director Timo Tjahjanto, is a strong contender for the most excessively violent, blood-drenched action flick ever made. The film's many fight scenes are wonderfully choreographed and flawlessly executed, Tjahanto's breath-taking direction employing shooting techniques that are guaranteed to astound, although it's the sheer quantity of blood and guts that really impresses.The film stars Joe Taslim as triad member Ito, who seeks redemption for all the terrible things that he has done by saving a young girl, Reina (Asha Kenyeri Bermudez), from his hit squad. Having gunned down his own men and escaped with the girl, Ito finds himself targeted by the triad's top killers, who include Raid star Iko Uwais as his old pal Arian, Julie Estelle (The Raid 2's Hammer Girl) as a motorcycle-riding assassin, and a pair of lesbian hit-women: Elena (Hannah Al Rashid), who is armed with a kukri knife, and Alma (Dian Sastrowardoyo), who wields a whirling wire weapon.As Ito, aided by his loyal friends Bobby (Zack Lee), Fatih (Abimana Aryasatya) and Wisnu (Dimas Anggara), battles to protect Reina, viewers are treated to all manner of graphic violence: bodies are beaten and mutilated, necks are slashed, and bones are broken. A man is hung on a meathook, someone is machine gunned in the face, and a grenade rips another poor bloke to pieces. There's a shotgun blast to the foot, a knife through the neck, a severed hand, an evisceration, pool balls to the skull, a hook in the crotch, a utility knife in the mouth (and through the cheek), and more bullet hits and stabbings than I can recall. The stuntwork is amazing and it's hard to believe that no-one was seriously injured.The carnage is so spectacular that it's easy to forgive the simplicity of the plot (the narrative is not nearly as involved as The Raid 2; it's more akin to the original Raid movie in terms of complexity).",

Drop in!I had just watched Live Up To Your Name-7.6 which involves time travel to/from the Joseon period, so redundancy was a concern. Turns out, there was no need to worry, tee-hee.There's nothing novel about entertainment features that portray time travel to a romanticized past era, anyway. Not only is the contrast between different cultures fascinating, but the fact that people are the same, no matter the circumstances, resonates.Did I say fascinating? Not on this show. This show displays that the differences are HILARI\ud83e\udd23US.What's so funny, you ask? Driving a big van through a cramped Joseon shopping district- after beheading the \"monster\" (the van) didn't work. Pulling out a 99cent lighter and causing panic. Teaching the Joseans \"2 thumbs up\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd,\" drinking games, or slang. Fine, it's all been done before, but this show reaches into the backseat and pulls out the laughs. It's all giggles until a misplaced history book almost wipes out Korea entirely. Oh my. What should we do?The van, Bong-Bong, is the most intelligent of the characters. Bong-Bong clearly has an agenda, and drives the plot, ahem.Speaking of characters, we have the petulant actress, the greedy flimflam artist, the Mute Ninja who communicates with his mind, the escaped princess, the villain (a narcissist in full bloom), and more.I loved this corny little show. The episodes are all just 30 minutes, so each one is its own brief escape. Bong-Bong may take me anywhere. Let him (yes, Bong-Bong is a male, even though On-dal calls him 'my lady' throughout) anyway, let him take you through 20 fun filled episodes.

That was the best thing I could do. This movie for sure works best when you just jump right into it and give yourself to it.I'm not sure where I should start with this piece of filmmaking but I think I'll just start with the performances which are absolutely brilliant and feel lived in. I truly believed in all of them and they did one hell of a job.Now to the direction, the pretty much flawless direction. It is insanely intense and you can feel the deep passion of this project and all its meanings. The execution of this whole experience is one that can't be praised enough.The main reasons why this remarkable movie works, in my opinion, are not its story but its characters that are so wonderfully brought to life by a dedicated cast, alongside the very naturalistic camerawork and of course the direction which is so personal and truthful in a way that is exceptional.I am sure there is much more to unpack, talk about and praise about it, like for example the remarkable sound of it, but I'll leave it at that for now.This is almost perfect to me, almost because there were some moments where it did not fully click for me just yet. Maybe it will completely do so after a second viewing.Roma is obviously a must-see and whether you see it in the comfort of your home, hopefully on a 4K TV at least, or in a cinema, this is going to affect you undoubtedly and that is what huge films can achieve.",

    "plot": "Final film directed by Ringo Lam, who passed away in December 2018.",
    "review": "Imagine throwing up your lunch, and looking down at the result. That's basically what Ringo Lam's 2016 Chinese action flick Sky on Fire is; a collection of random pieces churned together without an ounce of cleverness, the result leaving me speechless - and not in a good way. Though his last foray, Wild City, was arguably sensational, and kept me rooted to the spot, Sky on Fire is an absolute insult to humanity - yes, it is that ridiculous.Don't get me wrong...the car chases are magnificently choreographed, with enough staged crashes and smashes to get your heart racing. The musical score, from its sweeping melodies to its beating drums is great, and if the film had any idea what it actually wanted to accomplish, the music would have made it that much more captivating. The computer generated effects are continuous, and though they are *ahem* obviously fake, they sure are pretty.Daniel Wu stars as Tianbo, the security chief at Sky One, a massive pharmaceutical corporation, where Dr Yu (the lovely Zhang Jingchu) has successfully developed the cure to cancer, using ex-stem cells (no idea what the \"ex\" means). Unfortunately, the stem cells are stolen, during a not-so-daring robbery by a gang of miscreants led by Ziwan (Zhang Ruo Yun), who spends most of the film looking as though he has no idea what's going on. Don't worry Zhang - I feel your pain. From tracking down the 'masterminds' (dripping with sarcasm I'm afraid) of the heist, to uncovering a slew of underwhelming conspiracies, Wu and the rest of the cast spend much of the film holding guns to each other's heads and shouting, the occasional fisticuffs looking like something ripped out of Team America. You would think with so many guns, someone might actually think to, well, shoot one, something that is rarely the case.Somehow, Jia (Chang Hsaio-Chaun) and his sister Jane (Amber Kuo), become embroiled in this affair. In the opening of the film, we discover Jane spontaneously, without explanation, has cancer, Jia sacrificing everything to save her. All the while, Yu's husband, Tang (Yao Fan-Kuang), the owner of the conglomerate, uses his personal lapdog Wolf (Li Haitao) to control the situation, his own agenda in mind.On paper, this almost sounds sane - it's the execution that is beyond acceptable. The aforementioned cast are just a small sample of the many faces that appear, not one of them receiving sufficient characterisation for us to understand their motives. We occasionally receive glimpses, in the form of convoluted flashbacks; example, melodramatic scenes of Tianbo's late wife, though how this relates to the plot, or his character, who seldom seems in mourning, is beyond me. On other occasions, Sky on Fire reveals too much, spoiling the story by revealing the villain halfway through.Don't even get me started on the dialogue. One moment it's pseudoscientific; the next it's so awkwardly tacky I wouldn't be surprised if it attracts its own face palm memes; the next, it's poetic. There is no rhyme or reason for any of it, Zhang Jingchu being perhaps the only actor who can emotionally empower the otherwise shameful script (I genuinely mean this as a compliment). Occasionally, Lam discusses the preciousness of life, an idea which seems in direct contrast with money, these been two of the central themes which very rarely work, click or do anything else.Finally, Lam's Sky on Fire has some good action scenes - perhaps he had some spare scenarios lying in his head, and threw them together, hoping for the best (which is a bit like me when I make dinner). Unfortunately, the end result is a punishingly bad film I wouldn't serve up to my worst enemy; to call it stupid would be an insult to every stupid film out there. Skip this if you can.",

    "review": "In my opinion, this movie is one of the fantastic Thai drama movies, especially for someone like me who struggles with love. The story follows an IT support guy who is in love with a marketing woman. The intriguing twist happens when the woman loses her memory for a day. During this time, the guy seizes the opportunity to pretend to be her boyfriend until her memory returns. It makes me think that spending a day with someone we love would be an amazing experience even if it's just for one day. The movie makes me feel lonely and helps me understand how the man feels. It's like you're stuck in a world where everything feels fake and nobody really cares about what you think or feel. But then, when you finally find someone who sees the real you and appreciates your worth, it's like finding a treasure. You feel a deep connection, and you want to do everything you can to make that person happy.One thing I didn't like about the movie was the beginning because it took a long time to introduce the main character. However, on the other hand, it helped us understand the character's situation better. If they didn't spend so much time at the beginning, they could have made the ending perfect without rushing it. Another thing is that the ending was easy to guess because when the woman's memory came back, she would forget everything she did with the guy. If they had a twist in the plot where the woman remembered her time with the guy, it would have been more interesting.The director picked Hokkaido, Japan, during wintertime, especially during the Snow Festival, to show that winter is a time when love can easily blossom. Hokkaido's snowy landscapes are peaceful and beautiful, making it a perfect backdrop for romance. The Snow Festival adds excitement and charm to the setting, just like the thrill of falling in love. By choosing this location and time of year, the director makes the movie feel more magical and romantic, highlighting the themes of love and new beginnings.Finally, I've realized this movie shares important ideas with viewers-like facing truths we can't avoid and accepting them. It suggests that sometimes, the person who loves you might be better for you than the one you love. It sheds light on different aspects of love, helping us understand it a bit better.I really love movies by director Banjong Pisanthanakun. He's done all sorts of movies, from funny-scary ones like \"P Mak\" to more classic scary ones like \"Medium.\" But \"Fanday\" is something special. It's one of his best, in my opinion. The movie mixes romance and drama really well, so you're hooked from the beginning to the end. You can see Pisanthanakun's special way of telling stories in every part of \"Fanday.\" If you're into movies, you're going to check this one out.",

    "plot": "Loosely inspired by the life and career of French actress Paula Maxa.",
    "review": "This somewhat unusual feature incorporates elements of slasher horror with a period drama. Its story centres around the woman who could be described as the original scream queen, Paula Maxa. She was the lead actress in the Parisian Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Grand-Guignol; a theatre infamous in some quarters for putting on dramatic shows which enacted out a variety of incredibly bloody murders. This is a place so influential on the subsequent horror cinema genre that the term Grand-Guignol has become a broad term readily associated with a certain type of gory excess. But even then, I daresay most people don't know a great deal about the place itself. Perhaps the chief strength of The Most Assassinated Woman in the World is that it is largely set in this theatre and showcases some of the salacious visceral plays they put on. I was actually quite amazed at the level of violence that these theatre productions revelled in and can see that they were precursors to the cinematic splatter movies kicked off with the release of Herschell Gordon Lewis's Blood Feast in 1963. Its probably no coincidence that the Grand-Guignol itself closed the year prior to that ground-breaking gore-fest, as once cinema finally caught up it was always going to struggle to remain as relevant.The movie itself mixes reality with fiction. To that end we have an authentic place and a bunch of real characters form the basis of the story. The one fictional character, the reporter Jean, is a connection to the other main invention of the serial killer who has an obsession with Maxa. But even this too had a basis in some reality in that there was an active serial killer operating in the Montmartre area at the time. It is overall a nicely original idea for a film and it makes a great backdrop for a story. I particularly liked the gloomy photography which not only reflected much of the Parisian art of the 1930's but also made you feel you really were in the bowels of this old theatre. It created considerable atmosphere. Anna Mouglalis is also excellent as Maxa, and the film tries to explore to some degree what it was like for her being effectively murdered on stage every night in a myriad of gruesome ways, many of which are listed in one inspired sequence. Another effective aspect was the score by Keren Ann, which mixed period accurate music with energetic modern stuff which combined to give the film a unique energy I thought.This is definitely a pleasingly distinctive movie. The excellent setting and interesting central character are enough in themselves to ensure this is a fascinating watch, with the bloody re-enactments in the theatre itself being enough of a reason alone to at least see this given their attention to authentic detail. But the whole production is elevated further by blending in a serial killer angle, dark past psychological events from the heroine's life and the additional pressures caused by the outcry of the moral guardians of the city. It ticks a few boxes, this one.",

    "review": "The movie had good cinematography and good acting. I don't remember having seen quite a similar story in any of the horror movies I have seen so far and I have seen many, so I would say some aspects of the story were original. Many ideas had been taken from movies such as Mirrors, the Unborn and other run-of-the-mill horror movies, so those scenes only served as a filler and didn't scare me at all. It did give me chills four or five times, so it wasn't a complete waste of time, but it didn't develop the scare factor as much as it could have, which is a real let down. The movie had potential to be really scary and leave you with lasting fear, but it was ultimately a failure.What really annoyed me were the lead actor and actress. While they delivered good performances, they didn't have the looks. When I looked at their facial expressions, I couldn't help but yawn, and this is bad for a horror movie that demands your full attention. I think what actors and actresses look like is important and they can make you love or hate a movie and not be really able to explain why you feel that way. The characters were also not as developed as they could have been. We could have been told a lot more about the wife's sister, the evil entity and what it really wanted, its motives, the mysterious woman and her warning, the origins of the entity and the box, the reason for what the husband did at the end of the movie, etc. All in all, the movie left a lot to be desired. What you're going to get out of watching this movie are a few chills and wishing it had been directed by Sam Raimi. Now, he could have made this into a real horror movie.",

    "review": "For those of us who have watched Brody and Malkovich films and not only appreciated their immense talents, but also respected their free will. For those of us who respect and appreciate their acting abilities and presence that draws viewers into whatever roll they are playing, whatever the vehicle, we might appreciate the story might be more believable, better directed or realized, but it is rare you doubt the actors themselves. Even if the vehicle is...a bit strange or problematic. I liked the film well enough, it wasn't a waste of time, as I liked the dialogues between the two, and the style of showing flashbacks visualizing their revelries was smoothly done. For me, it didn't detract or disrupt the flow. That being said, the story didn't have great depth. It was a \"slice of life\" in a trio of career criminals day who were interrupted by a dog with issues. which viewers are given a glimpse into.As some others have said, I thought the perspective of the dog was very well done, to help viewers better understand their perspective, even if overall the premise was almost comedic, but perhaps that was the mission of the writer carried out by the director. If so, it was fulfilled nicely. I've never seen Cujo. I've never seen Reservoir Dogs either. I think it doesn't matter, as they say, \"comparisons are odious.\" The characters of Malkovich and Brody had good conversations and solid presence thoroughout. Their choice in the roles on a clearly non-Oscar worthy script will, of course, be debated by known critics and armchair criticizers, but the emotional aspects of the characters? I can understand why they took the roles. Besides they maybe liked each other, the director, or whatever else. To me, it was far from a waste of time. Another Kulkin, wasn't terrible either, but predictable, as the inevitable conclusion of the story takes place.",

She basically says \"No! It's gotta be something else's fault not mine.\" and acts totally out of immaturity.\n It's a small movie, so do't see it if you want a blockbuster. I expect to see it at indie movie houses for years to come.",

I will say that Thomas Jane was expertly cast for this role, and he really lived up to the role in every sense. He was very believable and pulled it off quite nicely.The rats were a fantastic image of Wilfred's guilt gnawing at him and gradually breaking down his psyche. There was a very good atmosphere throughout the entire movie.The great costumes and make-up also helped the movie along quite nicely.If I have to put my finger on something here, then I would say that the storyline did suffer from being somewhat predictable though.",

DeLorean was found to be siphoning off tens of millions form that factory to off-shore accounts, and then to his own personal accounts. there is evidence that he bribed Labor Party officials who had set up the original deal to massively fund the debacle. (if you want to know more google Ivan Fallon's piece \"The man who fooled the world).\n2. The Delorean was profoundly unsafe vehicle. It was not political machinations that produced those results but every government and independent testing group. It was also never a performance car as promised. It was mediocre in acceleration, cornering etc with a couple of bottled on \"innovations\" that were not really useful at all (gull wing doors).\n3. DeLorean was not \"framed.\" He was heavily involved in drugs including parties where he provided them for a very long time. He was aware of what hardcore drugs do -- his own father died from a narcotics addiction and overdose. He was attempting to profit from something he knew firsthand destroyed lives.\n4. The GTO was not his invention, nor was the Firebird. They were created by teams of hundreds of engineers and marketing experts.

My complaint with this movie is with the characters. The characters have little to no development or depth. Again I want to restate that it's not a bad movie, at points, you can feel as if the characters could be real people and connect with them. However these moments are cliche and very few. At it's worst, the movie will throw ideas in the air and never come back to them. Special effects are very well done and don't let down. The plot was generic but still enjoyable. Overall, this movie is good for casual audiences and people that just wanna sit down and turn off their brain for an hour after a long day. If you want something with a lot more to offer than this then I wouldn't recommend watching this movie.",

    "review": "For me, \"Riptide,\" is a Stephen Cannell TV show from the 80s. Yes, I knew going into \"Rip Tide\" there would be no Sikorsky, robot, or detective story. While that was slightly disappointing for me, I mention this so you know something about the author of this review. Why was I watching this movie? I like smaller films and independent filmmakers. Things I liked: Australia. The New South Wales locations were stunningly beautiful. I can't mention the natural beauty of the land without also giving a nod to the composition and cinematography that captured it. This aspect of the movie was very satisfying. The location acted as a perfect contrast for NYC and the ideal place where Cora could reconnect with her extended family and her inner self longing to break free.One of the best sequences in the film was when Cora is coaxed into the ocean by Chicka. The experience for Cora is depicted as baptism. She goes down into the water, and this begins her cleansing from the pain and filth of her trouble in NYC. This is the point at which Cora commits herself to the transformation she desired to accomplish in setting out for Australia. Australia is the land \"down under\" and Cora goes down under the water to become a new person. She is turning her world upside down, and this foreshadows what will transpire later in the story. When Cora receives the call to return to NYC, all the inner healing she accomplished is thrown into reverse and culminates in a \"reverse baptism,\" going backwards up through the water and out into her old life. To me, this was an example of the pinnacle of the film's artistry, giving us a view into what is happening inside Cora just with the images alone. Very well done, I think.I really liked the characters played by Valerie Bader and Naomi Sequeira. Bee, Chicka, and Tom are especially important roles because they have little pretense. This is exactly opposite to the catty, backstabbing crowd Cora is more familiar with at home. Ultimately, this is a \"catalyst\" character story. Cora, Margot, Bee, and Tom all have inner pain to be worked through. Cora will be the catalyst for the Australian group's pain and the Australian group will be the catalyst for Cora's struggle. Once Cora appears in Australia, the fuse it lit, and the mutual emotional reactions begin with hopefully good results by the end. That's the general idea for the story.Criticisms: Story and character development. I'm sure the pressure to get everything done on time and within budget was just crushing. In fact, the whole production feels pressured. Many of the key moments in the film should have been refined more and re-shot. Miss Ryan also needed more directorial guidance for her performance in key scenes. Miss Ryan is a remarkable and capable young actor working to extend beyond comedy into drama. That's not easy to do, and it doesn't help if the entire production is stressed and compressed. Screen Canberra claims the movie was shot in 18 days and took six months total from money drop to debuting at Sydney film festival. Impressive, but I think the schedule may also have caused problems in the product. Furthermore, the story was underdeveloped and did not explore the emotional journeys of the characters in significant depth. As a result, the explosive moment between Cora and Margot was more cringe-inducing than emotionally fulfilling. The whole movie is a character story, but the emotional aspects of the characters' problems and pain are only allowed to create major conflict in a few places. So, the rest of the time the action is listless, unfocused, and dysfunctional. This was really disappointing to me. The story should have developed the baptismal idea further and given us Cora's wilderness journey since a time of suffering/wandering must always follow baptism. The call to return to NYC could then be cast as a temptation to be avoided rather than the reversal it was portrayed to be.",

    "review": "A Ghost Story marks David Lowry's return to cinema since his 2013 indie hit \"Ain't Them Bodies Saints\". Telling the story of a young couple (Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara) who buy a home and plan to start a life together in it until tragedy strikes. The Man suddenly dies and leaves the wife to fend for herself and build a life in the house by herself instead of with the man she loves. All while she is going through this in reality, the Man begins to haunt the home in a classical white sheet donning way. Throughout the years of being trapped to haunt this home, The Ghost also has to witness the love of his past life continue on without him and experience the moments of life without him. It is a beautiful and heart wrenching film that delves deeper into what grief does to not only a person but to a ghost.Whether you believe in an after life or not, A Ghost Story isn't worried about your beliefs. It plays out like a fantasy and that's how it stays which really bodes well for it. It never reaches beyond what is happening with the Man and the Woman and, of course, the House (which becomes a character in and of itself). David Lowry does a great job at setting up a \"what if\" scenario that all you can do is ask yourself, \"what would I do in this situation?\" The scariest part of that is there is literally nothing you can do. That rationalization is probably scarier than most horror films out today. The film itself is a very digestible 90 minutes which is of a perfect length for this film because it doesn't go overboard and forget what it is. It's a horror film that is light on scares but heavy on thoughts and brains. There's no real scares. The big scare is putting yourself in the shoes of the ghost. What would you do if you had to witness your loved one go through grief and you couldn't do anything about it? You couldn't comfort them. You couldn't hold them. You could just watch. What if the person you loved moved on from you? What if they forget you? These questions are what made A Ghost Story scary for me. The level of helplessness that the film portrays is horrifying enough to remind audiences that death is still scary.Overall, the film is an experimental ghost story that shows Lowry in top form both as a writer and a director. The crass nature of reality is that death is lonely and he captures that perfectly. While many who take a look at the poster will certainly think that the film is just another horror movie trying to capitalize on some paranormal money, A Ghost Story is much more than that. It is beautiful to watch, heart wrenching to experience and an absolute delight cinematically.",

    "review": "Years after a notorious serial killer of teenage girls stops, loving son (Charlie Plummer) finds evidence to suggest his father (Dylan McDermott) may have been responsible. Slowly, with the help of new girlfriend (Madisen Beaty) whose mother was killed by the the eponymous villain, the evidence begins to mount up.Slow-burn thriller that nicely highlights the macabre contradictions between a perfect loving family in gun toting, American bible belt country with a psychopath killer within. McDermott is terrific as the killer who still feels the right to hold his head high because of his god fearing / family loving ways, despite tying up and strangling young girls. This belief by father and ultimately his son leads nicely to a slightly off kilter, but nonetheless persuasive and enjoyable climax which has tended to be criticised by critics as being too action oriented, but which I thought fitted quite nicely.",

The last few episodes, however, were really good, part of the romantic scenes that were plenty, but boring. Yes, the two leads had chemistry, but couldn't the romance be more original? Anyway, the romantic scenes kind of pulled the pace back to the slow slaggish one we had in the first episodes, but at least the story was interesting at last. The mystery of the father, the depth of the characters and their choices that changed the future, everything was thrilling and entertaining. The ending was a let down, though I don't really know how they could have handled the romance otherwise. Other than that, the performances were good and the representation of the 80' era decent.",

Withdrawn instead offers something far greater: an entertaining yet meaningful glimpse into the existence and routines, as well as the internal struggles and motivations, of a young man and his acquaintances, separate from any big convoluted plot.It feels real and it feels fresh. It's all in the subtext. And best of all, it's easily available right now at the click of a button, streaming on Netflix. So what are you waiting for? Go watch it!",

    "review": "The impulse is to compare this with Archer, because the aesthetic and premise are similar, but the shows are structured differently. Pacific Heat has a much faster joke delivery; it's easy to miss the jokes if you aren't listening. It relies more on wordplay and dialogue jokes instead of the esoteric reference jokes found in Archer. Also, unlike Archer, there is no one obvious protagonist. The characters are understated and static, but this is only the first season, so that may change as the show finds its groove. If you come in hoping for a rehash of Archer, you will be disappointed. If you accept it as a totally new show, you may enjoy it.Pros: Snappy dialogue, funny characters,fast delivery, lots of potentialCons: Audio sometimes is muddled or unintelligible due perhaps in part to production value, the speed of dialogue, and the thick accents. Also, Asian/Middle Eastern character voices/accents are cringe- worthy and come off as a bit racist.",

    "review": "It seems Antonio Banderas is making a lot of movies of the same genre lately. This is not to say that's bad. I Think he does quite a good job as an \"average man\" tough guy. This film is no different, however, there are some exceptions.I gave this film a generous 7/10. Mostly because I am liking Banderas more and more of late and the plot of this film, although flimsy at times, is pretty good and fast paced.As in 90% of my reviews, I try to avoid spoilers at all costs as to not ruin it for future viewers. I will stick to that rule and simply talk about what I did and did not like about this film....first, this is a plot we have seen before but was done with some different twists and a solid unforeseeable outcome. Banderas' character is a man on a mission after the murder of his wife and daughter. He is a defense attorney with no fighting or \"revenge\" skills but learns them quickly as the police seem uninterested in finding the person/persons responsible. This is where He takes matters into his own hands. The film has some excellent choreographed fight scenes and the pace of the film is without boredom. However, the way our protagonist goes about learning how to become a \"tough guy\" is quite far out and unbelievable.Throughout the film, there are quotes regarding \"revenge\" from Marcus Aurelius' meditations, in six parts. Each act is then played out after the quote is read on screen.In summation: a worthwhile film with some good action scenes and a solid but familiar story line. Much of the fight scenes from Bandwras' perspective is unrealistic but entertaining. If you are a fan of the action/ thriller and revenge sub genre, you won't be disappointed. If your looking for something new and original, this film won't make the cut.It was not 90 minutes of boredom or a waste of time....",

I believe, this movie should pay tribute to Fukushima 50, the name of the group of volunteers that stay and handle the situation within 20km zone around the Fukushima Daiichi plant.",

    "review": "Adrift is a beautiful little tale about a young couple who fall foul of a severe storm while out boating.Starring the underrated Shailene Woodley and Hunger Games star Sam Claflin it at it's core is a love story but like all love stories it's also a tragedy.Based on a true story it plays out on two fronts, what is presently happening and the flashbacks that explain how it all came to be.The movie is rather devoid of originality and we have seen it all before (Even the twist) but the film does have a strong cast and excellent cinematography to fall back on and that certainly rises it above the average.I like Woodley, I expected her to have a considerably bigger career than she has and hope that competent little movies like this where she really shines can do something about that.The film is utterly beautiful and worth your time even if you'll know exactly how it's going to play out.The Good:Very well actedVisually stunningThe Bad:Hardly originalThings I Learnt From This Movie:When suffering from dehydration the best thing to do is drink alcoholWhy do I feel like Woodleys career has been eclipsed by Jennifer Lawrence?",

The lead role's personality is so naive it's insufferable.The story line is full of filler scenes and is hard to follow, due to the odd cut scenes, bad dialogue, and no visual perspective (the camera stays zoomed in on faces throughout, with very rare zoomed out scenes). The camera often blends different photos in the background to indicate that time went by in the movie... I thought this technique went out of style years ago.It is extremely disappointing how little actual facts were presented. After seeing the trailer, I was looking forward to the scientific and legal details, since in reality there are plenty. But to be honest there aren't many shown and you could basically infer everything that happens in the movie from the trailer.I really have no idea why they decided to base the movie's plot about the girl's naivete and feelings rather than detailed facts from multiple characters' perspectives.

    "review": "A brief look at the IMDb reviews put up there and one will be able to find a lot of hate for this movie. They say: there are no new insights to the case, basically a bunch of random strangers gossiping about and dramatizing the death of a child. This film is all of that, and because of that, it is great. I came into the film not knowing a single thing about the case. (I've yet to reach twenty and I do not live in the west) And it is through this film, through these gossips by these strangers that I have managed to piece together a vague sense of what the case is all about. But this understanding of mine that I received on what happened to the child is a dramatized and subjective rendition of the proceedings.The people interviewed are your regular Tom and Jane on the street. The answers they share are less of an expert's and more of the opinion being spread out on the streets, what the people believe. The subjects feel very assured of what they believe, which theory they believe. Their answers to the questions are filled with the passion of a group of people sharing their ideas on the case. They draw from their personal experiences and from their subjective ideas. Many of the interviewees personalize the case too much and as such it is definitely not something to be taken as the truth.Though this leads to some extremely fascinating scenes where the interviewees appear to be relating and perhaps even sympathizing with the proposed perpetrator in their theories of the case. Further more the fact that these interviewees are actually auditioning to be acting as the people they talk about serves to further blur the identities between the 'perpetrator' and the regular human being. Perhaps we all have the potential commit an act or play a part in something so horrifying. After all, we are all human. We make mistakes. In this respect, the film reminds me of the great documentary 'The Act of Killing' where the lines between the identity of fiction and reality, history are blurred. Of course 'Casting JonBenet' does not solely focus on the blurring of identity and the aspects of human nature, but there are moments where the tragic loss of the child can be felt from through the subjects, how they felt about it, how they can relate to the death. A little superficial perhaps, but it does not feel sentimental as many conventional documentaries would have done if they were in the shoes of such a topic. It feels earnest and real. This movie is not the typical documentary typically known to the mainstream, it's goal is less focused on delivering information to the public in an entertaining manner but rather, just as some of the best documentaries do, it focuses on exploring the human condition. This film is less about the case of Jonbenet but more about the normal person's interpretation, reaction and their personal bits of introspection regarding the tragic incident. The film certainly is not without faults, there are plenty. But my main complaint would be that the reaches not much of a conclusion and the montage near the end emphasizes a little too much on the film's concept and ends up feeling more manufactured than earnest and emotional.",

For anyone who is unware or minimally familiar with the extent of the government's brutal treatment of the majority of its citizens throughout the history of South Africa, this documentary did not provide a meaningful context for Winnie Mandela's life and the lives of all non-white people under apartheid, but to have done that would have been a daunting, lengthy undertaking.Another reviewer felt that Winnie's involvement in the death of Stompie Moeketsi and with the Mandela Football club was whitewashed in this documentary. I didn't find that to be the case. Even Desmond Tutu's plea to her to admit whatever she had done and the fact that she was asked to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission were documented. Clearly that provided evidence that she was thought to be complicit. But it was also evident that the government, factions within the ANC, Inkhata and Mangosuthu Buthelezi all exploited the charges against her in the media and through other propaganda. A former government official admitted as much.Did she involve herself in violence? Almost certainly. Did what she may have done compare in any way to the total violence against people under apartheid. Not even close. Were the ANC and Inkhata and the government of the day in a position to throw stones? Hardly.I'm not excusing what she did or her refusal to acknowledge it. But she was never likely to be given a fair hearing in the public or in any court. The testimony of supposed witnesses was remarkably inconsistent and in many case the same witness told stories that were totally different each time they testified or were interviewed, as was explained in the documentary.I lived in southern Africa for nearly a quarter century during the time that encompassed the period before and after the independence of Zimbabwe and during the time that some of the ANC leadership was in exile in Lusaka until Nelson Mandela was installed as president of SA. A good deal of what happened during these periods of transition was horrific and there was plenty of blame to go around.. Despite some legitimate questions that can be raised about the behavior of some, or maybe all, of those involved, the fact remains that Winnie Mandela was extraordinarily brave and that her life was extraordinarily difficult. Very few important figures in world history, no matter how revered they may be, could withstand meticulous scrutiny of everything they did without tarnishing their reputations.

There is something horribly feasible in the premise and the writing is naturalistic without ever becoming drab or dull. This is a story you can believe is happening right now in little communities all over the world and it tells this story without sensationalism or soap opera heaviness.The narrative is fragmented into episodes of Menashe having fun with his son, doing his job and Jewish stuff. It's a serene and rather charming vision into the life of someone is really just a regular guy, he happens to just be part of a particular community he has no desire to subvert or part from, yet find himself victim to the values he has implicitly accepted.The film is at its most charming when Menashe is with his son. The details of this brand of Judaism which Menashe tries uphold and pass down to him really make the movie memorable and touching while those very same values strive to keep them apart.This will not be everyone's cup of tea: although nothing transgressive it will simply be too leisurely and uneventful for many people and this is indeed a movie where you just have to feel the moment: the prayers at a cemetery, picking a painting of a Rabbi etc. You may easily find it hard to stay awake or watch this in one sitting. But for what it is, it is pretty much note perfect and leaves you with a powerful sense of the quite desperation and helplessness that so many of us just have to live with.There is a moment where I was holding my breath, you'll know it when you see it...",

Ruby Ridge and Waco had nothing to do with Oklahoma City, and neither did the militia movement or white supremacist organizations. This documentary is little more than the official government story, a story orchestrated at the highest levels of the Justice Department and the White House, placing all of the blame upon a disillusioned ex-soldier and his loser Army buddies and ignoring the obvious presence of more sophisticated conspirators. The film barely mentions the existence of \"John Doe #2\" who actually DID mastermind the bombing. There was a nationwide manhunt for this person during the week after the bombing until the FBI decided that they had their man and no further suspects were being sought. We are supposed to believe that McVeigh was smart enough to plan this elaborate scheme and yet stupid enough to drive a getaway car without a license plate attached? The film completely ignores the pre-bombing trips to the Philippines that were taken by Terry Nichols and clear evidence that he was meeting there with Ramzi Yousef (the mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing in 1993). Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying McVeigh was innocent. He was in this conspiracy up to his eyeballs and he deserved to be convicted, but there were other conspirators higher up the food chain that got away, for purely political reasons. That is the real story of Oklahoma City.",

The character and set designs are amazing to look at, everything moves with graze and effortless fluidity, and there isn't a hair out of place, figuratively speaking.The musical score is also nice, the voice actors are extremely talented and the whole film has this warm, inviting, fairytale-esque feeling to it.Which is why, it's my sad duty to inform you that the script is rather awful. I have not read the original novel, The Little Broomstick, but I'm somewhat familiar with Mary Stewart, the author. Studio Ponoc has essentially taken a quintessentially British children's novel and turned its mood, its atmosphere on its head, adding in a lot of unneeded anime tropes and visuals. Studio Ghibli had this same problem with Tales from Earthsea. It was an okay film on its own, but it felt like a huge betrayal for all fans of the original Earthsea books.I also don't enjoy the fact that Mary does not learn a thing throughout the course of the film. By the end she's essentially the same character she was in the beginning. And that's a big no-no in stories aimed at children.Mary and the Witch's Flower is not the worst anime film I've ever seen, but it is certainly lacking in depth, heart and message. Technically superb, but empty on the inside.",

The story, such as it is, features Harrelson playing 'himself' falling out with his wife and get into various mishaps as he tries to get back to her.As a film, it's pretty slight, although Harrelson is very good as the witty, lost, selfish and naive film star lost in the big city. There are some fun scenes and some dull bits - Harrelson's row with Owen Wilson where they rip each other's films apart is wonderful. All this though takes a back seat to appreciating the quite incredible skills in pulling this together, as far as I can tell, without a mistake, whilst keeping pace and solid performances going.",

The direction which was made by Alexandre Aja was very good and he presented very well the whole concept of the movie and the main idea behind his main character. In addition to this, the interpretation of M\u00e9lanie Laurent who played as Elizabeth 'Liz' Hansen was simply amazing and she made the difference. The selection of Mathieu Amalric as voice of M. I.

    "review": "POSTER BOYS is the story of three men whose lives turn upside down for no fault of theirs. Vinay Sharma (Bobby Deol) is a docile school teacher, Arjun Singh (Shreyas Talpade) is an over enthusiastic school teacher while Jagaavar Chaudhary (Sunny Deol) is the explosive but also well-mannered retired army officer. They reside in a village called Jangheti and one day, they find their pictures on a poster promoting vasectomy. They are immediately ridiculed and the trio try their best to convince their near and dear ones that they haven't undergone the procedure and that their pictures have been wrongly used. They decide to take on the system to avenge the humiliation that they suffered. What happens next and whether they get justice forms the rest of the film.POSTER BOYS doesn't start on a great note. The beginning portions are stretched, with the family members and acquaintances ridiculing the trio but not telling them the reason for the same. Also the TV style flashback portions look poor. The film picks up when the trio meet each other at the bridge. From here, the film turns into a fairly entertaining ride right till the end with no dull moment anywhere. A Few scenes stand out like Jagaavar stopping Arjun and Vinay from fighting, the trio going to local health office, the interval point, Jagaavar getting a call from Riya (Tripti Dimri) at midnight, Jagaavar and Vinay fooling the doctor (Ashwini Kalsekar) etc. The climax is quite exciting and it's praiseworthy how the makers have managed to seamlessly add a social message into the narrative.Shreyas Talpade's story is novel and makes for an entertaining film. Bunty Rathore and Paritosh Painter's screenplay is effective overall, despite an average beginning. The fun element never stops and that is quite a feat. Bunty Rathore and Paritosh Painter's dialogues are hilarious and witty and one of the highpoints of the film. Shreyas Talpade's direction is quite good and he makes a great directorial debut. He ensures the subject isn't dumbed down and that audiences aren't taken for granted. Also, the way he and his team has made references to Deol brothers' earlier films like DAMINI, SOLDIER etc. is quite smartly done.",

The arranged marriage scenario was common in Asian families a couple of generations ago and still exists today but not as common. Maybe it's because I'm Chinese, so I understand why Song Yi Jie and Ke Wei Xiang would agree to get married and the humor of their situation, but I don't think you have to be Chinese or some other Asian ethnicity to find this series funny. The main characters are well developed. I loved watching the relationship between Wei Xiang and Yi Jie grow organically. The funniest moments are Wei Xiang's attempts to tell Yi Jie that he loves her and the family dynamics/relationships. The brother, Wei Cheng, is such a lovable jerk.

It was like watching a train wreck or a car smash; I wanted to look away, but I couldn't. I was gobsmacked both by these delusional, self-important, spoiled-brats of young men and by the oodles of screaming girls (and some boys) who follow after them. I just couldn't believe people like this exist! These good-looking, sometimes personable, sometimes obnoxious, entitled but extremely untalented (and extremely unaware of it) young men walk around as if what they do online and in life actually has some value or merit. They have the hubris to refer to themselves during this series as 'the talent' (despite having none) and 'influencers'. Heaven help us if these people actually have influence, but I guess they may because it seems there are actually young people who are caught up in all this, attending their idols' appearances, screaming, fainting and acting like they were at a Beatles concert in the 1960's. It's absolutely unbelievable. I hope for their sakes that these young guys made money out of this stage of their lives and that they have invested it wisely, because at some point it will all come crashing down and they'll be forgotten. It has to happen. (Please let it be soon!)This is a fascinating and scary insight into the cult of celebrity, although I don't think that was the makers' intention.

    "review": "The genre of \"gay thriller\" has definitely been evolving to the point that once in awhile, there are films that exceed expectations. \"Last Ferry\" is not one of them. While there are some decent performances (Sheldon Best stands out) the rest of the characters really aren't strong enough to \"carry\" the film (especially the lead, who just spends most of the film practicing his \"clueless\" expression). While I've never been to Fire Island, I find it a bit hard to believe that in the modern era of cel phones a serial predator who drugs/mugs victims wouldn't eventually be identified. So, from the beginning there is quite a bit of suspension of disbelief to overcome (maybe if this were set in the 70's? Maybe that's actually when it was written? I dunno, but in the present it really doesn't work). There's a little skin, a little eye-candy, a little romance...but all in all it just comes off as a very well-edited and filmed low budget effort with little substance.",

It touches on the chokehold, Daryl Gates, the Olympics, the Rodney King beating, store keeper Mrs Du's killing of Latasha Harlins, and finally the not guilty verdict in the Rodney King trial.It's 25 years later. The recent O.J. shows have reignited interest in the events of that era in L.A. The first half lays out the situation over that 10 years period. The second half recounts those harrowing days concentrating on a few stories including interviews with those convicted of the Reginald Denny beating. Bobby Green's calling from God is probably the most emotional moment. I certainly hope for a ray of light from the higher power in this darkest day. This is not an all-encompassing documentary of the event. It touches on most of the important issues and players in the story although it may not be the final word. It does bring the viewer back to those days of chaos.",

    "review": "This film did a great job in corroborating the statements made in it with hard evidence, and that is very important. What is most important about this film is how it exposes the \"COINTELPRO\", psychological warfare and disinformation operations which have dominated the subject for years.Speaking of COINTELPRO and disinformation, a word of warning to use discernment when reading the other reviews on this film, paid shills come in all forms. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions, the evidence is available for all to seek it.Dr. Steven Greer makes it clear how it is possible that we can live in a time where we simultaneously have an abundance of rock hard evidence available which indicates we are being visited by advanced interstellar cultures and at the same time still have a significant number of people who scoff at the idea of an ongoing ET presence. He shines light onto some rather unsettling but undeniable truths about the world we live in. The film explains in detail how for over a century important clean energy technology has been kept 'under wraps' in order to perpetuate the status quo for those in the echelons of material power on earth. As I watched this documentary and thought about how some people react to this topic (despite the abundance of evidence which demonstrates the phenomenon and related zero point energy tech is real) I was reminded of how there was a time when mainstream science professed that a heavier than air piece of machinery could never take flight. If it wasn't for the Wright brothers being open to all possibilities and then acting upon that innate facet of the true pursuit of science, it would be a whole lot harder today to visit relatives and see the world. I think it's an illuminating thing to consider, that those 747s we now take for granted as we 'hop across continents' are derived from a form of technology/science that was once considered to be \"impossible\" by the mainstream scientific establishment. This film shows how we are now living in a similar situation in regards to the our modern mainstream establishment's attitude towards zero point energy technology and technology which can produce/manipulate artificial gravity fields.Greer and his team drive home the inescapable fact that we carry around computers in our pockets, our scientists create nanotechnology and are close to creating artificial intelligence. Yet when it comes to the propulsion systems that power our transportation infrastructure, we are using essentially the same technology (jet engines and internal combustion engines) that our grandparents used to get around. It made me consider the fact that when we get in an airplane now, and travel across the country, we are getting to our destination in roughly the same amount of time (and in essence using the same basic technology) as someone who was flying in the late 50s. It's clear to me that the particular stagnation of technology in the areas of energy generation and propulsion, which is apparent throughout the past few decade, breaks from the established pattern of innovation humanity has been on since the dawn of the industrial revolution.\"Unacknowledged\" clearly demonstrates how we live in a time on earth where the use of gasoline to power vehicles has been obsolete for over 6 decades. The clean and cheap technology that could have been used to replace internal combustion engines has been suppressed and horded by a few greedy power hungry humans and the institutions they run. It shows how the energy technology related to the ET presence is the main reason for the active suppression of the truth (which is so prevalent in the mainstream media on this issue). The film shows how our planet is being polluted and poisoned unnecessarily and all so a few humans can hold onto the illusion of power and accumulate obscene material wealth through the petroleum industry. After all scientists and engineers mastered gravity control and zero point energy modules decades ago. Indeed, the documentary shows how this silent, clean, efficient technology has the potential to transform our world into a paradise where there are no \"haves or have-nots\". However, the fearful people behind USAPs prefer to keep humanity from blossoming into this potential simply to continue feeding their own greed and lust for power.\"Unacknowledged\" shows how we must strive to speak openly, concisely and with confidence when we deal with this issue as to dissipate the foggy derisive and dissuasive atmosphere that has engulfed this most important issue of our times and bring clarity to a reality that when fully understood will bring about a new paradigm for humanity on planet earth.In closing, I leave you with this thought that arose in me when I contemplated the inevitability of the doorway opening for humanity to engage in amiable interactions with our cosmic neighbors. Never before will humanity have come across a mirror of such crystal clarity as the one which will be shown to us the day we make open contact with an interstellar civilization. In the face of such a reflection of what we could be, it will shine light onto what we have chosen to become. We will no longer have a way to hide things under the rug, nor to justify the ugliness and depravity we inflict upon each other. This mirror will be reflecting the full extent of our dormant virtuous human potential and give us an opportunity to choose again.\ufeff",

There were so many emotions played out in this movie, it should be impossible not to relate to.The topic is a coming-of-age story. Two young people in the big city, who want to experience everything. And it seems like everything is available today. And your smartphone just amplifies all the choices you have. The tone of the movie is slow and somewhat grey all throughout. Camera action and music is slow and deliberate really supporting the heavy emotions. It is not sad though. Just really intense. The movie explores many emotions and experiences, and gives you plenty of time to feel them yourself. Don't want to spoil it, but they get to go through a lot.The main casting was really good. Actors took their time to get into the roles. Some background stories were told but only when needed. Also plenty of good supporting roles.It all makes for a very interesting story, and as a viewer you really relate to the characters and what they go through.It is rare that a movie has the guts and takes the time to deal with so much, and do it so well.The subjects are bound to cause reflection, so if you watch it with your significant other, be ready to take some time afterwards to reflect and discuss.I was very impressed 10/10",

The 'villain' of the movie is a bit too much in my opinion, but there are people in this world like him. There are human being who behave like that, and it's really uplifting to see the girls unit.

    "review": "This is very well acted, filmed, and produced, but disruptively structured, with a plot weakness and too much left unsaid. And call me a na\u00efve idealist, but I was unhappy that the ending leaves Justice imperfectly satisfied. Or rather, that the main characters seem to have no problem with the final status quo.And so, \"The Tree of Blood\" is difficult to rate. I wanted to know, what was the big secret of Rebeca's and Marc's relationship? Getting there was an interesting pain in the rear. Interesting, because a great deal is going on; the film is full of intrigue, action, love, lust, and betrayal; the main characters win our sympathy. A pain because of shifts back and forth in time, the necessarily large number of inter-related characters to track, and the short shrift given to a few details.The setting shifts repeatedly between past and present, and in several scenes, characters of the present are shown standing in the action of the past, watching but not interacting. This disrupts the flow, yes, but not horribly so. Where the structure fails is that it falsely implies that Rebeca's and Marc's storytelling - the wrapper around the events of the past - are a fact-finding mission. You realize in the end that she had all the facts before they began, and only one key event was unknown to him.The presence of Russian and Ukrainian mafias in Basque Country, and especially why they should happen to conflict with the other characters, was unclear. Perhaps - although I doubt it - events such as these are so taken for granted in Spain that they literally need no introduction. The rest of us could have used some clarity.As symbology, the tree itself fell flat.Julio Medem also directed \"Sex and Lucia\", which had a somewhat less convoluted plot structure and which worked much better in the end. And his \"Room in Rome\" was almost purely linear, but still spellbinding. \"The Tree of Blood\" just doesn't quite measure up to those works.",

    "review": "As far as modern movie musicals of 2018 go, this is the best one of the year. It's quite slow at times but never lags, because of its great editing, jumping between different temporal narratives.We are told the true life story of folk singer Blaze Foley, who is played magnificently by Ben Dickey. Blaze is as charming as he is obnoxious, but sings like an angel who's had one whisky and a pack of smokes too many, and at times he let's us glance at his emotional core which makes one forgive him all his many, many character flaws.A good film worth watching.

It is a well made film, professionally directed and produced, despite a slightly old fashion a d artisanal look-and-feel. The plot, though well conceived, is affected by a few mistakes which to a certain degree put me off; one is a detail of general context: every time the players get of the cars there is a crowd of paparazzi waiting for them....paparazzi in Warsaw in 1962? Excuse me?\nThen there are a few more substantial mistakes regarding the espionage tradecraft: is it possible that there was no more discreet place for a Russian spy to pass a super secret microfilm to the opposition than a crowded chess world championship at the centre of everybody's attention? Lastly, there are a few too many murders, and it is well known that killing was a means used very very exceptionally by field agents in the course of their operations.\nNevertheless the movie is a decent one and quite watchable.",

I do miss the constant narration of the original show but its a nice addition when Glover comes on. In the interim, there's a lot of vocalizations from detectives and family members. Like a lot of modern shows, they do have a large amount of written info that is not offered verbally, so if you're not actually watching 100% you might miss important details. There are somewhat annoying aspects, such as the intentionally slow speech to drag the show out, repetitive info, and inaccurate visuals - like when they find out it wasn't Danita they still keep showing her pic while discussing the new suspect; however, contrary to one review, it is indeed a 1971 Ford Pinto in the Officer Down episode, not a Pacer - often confused by casual observers. There is a lot of blood and disturbing imagery but not as bad as CSI, for instance. Some are frustrating to realize the perp was the original suspect but some clue or witness was not in the open for decades. Glad these fams got some closure.",

    "review": "This tender and beautifully made movie is quite obvious and predictable. But it is worth to sacrifice originality when your goal is to focus in the moral message. And this movie has a strong an powerful moral message, so overwhelming that it makes you feel almost like in a church listening a sermon of an old and good hearted priest. It is like 2 hours of visual Aesop greek fables where the characters, instead of animals, are archetypical humans. The most important critic is to our own Spanish history: the National Basketball team cheated in the Paralympic Games of Sydney 2000, because 10 out of 12 of our basketball players did not have any mental disability. They won the gold medal, but they had to return it afterwards. Also the film showcases the extraordinary negative consequences of hyper protective parenthood in raising narcissistic people, completely immature in their 30s an 40s to the point that they can not endure the risks and challenges of sustaining a relationship, facing rejection or creating a family. Specially consistent during the whole film is the critic to our society, based in success over experience, performance over playfulness, fitness over kindness, dominance over community. Finally, the most subtle but powerful subversive message in the movie is questioning to which extent are sick and poisoned the people that consider ourselves \"normal\". Much of our \"normality\" might be counter productive, to the point to make us too rigid, cold hearted and stressed because of our own insane standards. All the special basketball players of this special team show us that most of the times it's ok to look silly, to do something stupid or to fail constantly, because they still have each other. So many of us can not say the same. This movie is such a nice, entertaining, sweet and tender way of reflecting about all these moral values. It's been selected to compete for the Oscar to the best foreign film, but honestly I think they have no chance. We are still too much into an Instagram Age to take a movie like this one seriously.",

    "review": "Ajji is among the most realistic and superlative films of independent cinema in 2017. A gritty and authentic take on revenge genre, it has the merit to stand out on its own virtues. An extremely important film with an essential social theme, this movie deserves to be seen by everyone.PROS.\n1. The screenplay of the film is impressive. Although not much things are happening on the screen, yet the film manages to stay intense from the beginning till the very end. 2. Performances of the cast are exquisitely amazing especially that of ajji. She should have won National award for her portrayal of this role. She submerges herself so much in the role that it becomes indistinguishable from reality. Rest of the film is also filled with powerhouse performances. If nothing else, this film can only be watched due to its performances. Easily on of the best acted film of the year...3.Direction is marvellous. Devashish Makhija manages to capture the raw emotion and intensity of the slums of Mumbai. His use of long shots are commendable, as they let the character to breathe and make a lasting appearance. He also manages to show the various trials and tribulations faced by the people of slum. The atmosphere created by him is incredibly intense and extremely authentic.4. Cinematography of the film is of top class. It manages to immerse you into the surrounding and helps to intensify the mood of the film. The film is easily among the most genuine portrayal of slum life in recent times.5. Powerful themes\nRevenge and justice are the main themes of the film. But other than that it also shades light on various issues like Rape culture, Biased judicial system, struggle between dignity and survival, Impotency of law, Flawed political system, Injustice faced by North Indians in Mumbai, Moral corruption etc...6. The mannequin scene\nThis scene features during the middle of the film and easily one of the most nightmarish and trippiest scene of all time. This scene acts as an allegory for rape. It is a vile and cringe inducing scenes which also can be interpreted as the metaphor for feminine atrocity. The frequent use of mobile phone's camera during this scene escalates its frightening effect.7.Background score is minimal yet helps to sharpen the atmosphere of the film. Sometimes the music even conveys what's going inside the mind of the characters. Here music in not just an add-on but is used as an storytelling device, and the payoff is brilliant.CONS.\n1. Slow Pace\nThe film is too slow in its pace and even at just 105 minutes runtime feels a bit long.2. There are some scenes that defies logic. Like how ajji manages to sneak out every night without getting noticed by anyone? Mother of the victim is shown in no grief even after such a huge happening. \nSo, all in all an incredibly well made film with passion and love for cinema. It's like a breath of fresh air. If you enjoy commercial cinema then there is nothing much here for you but if you are a true cinema lover do watch it. It's a must watch for everyone!",

    "review": "I'm a 35 year old with CF. I was excited about this movie because any representation is potentially great. But I've seen other CF movies, seen it on TV, and it's usually terribly done. Incorrect nonsense, people are on o2 but climbing hills like it's no big deal, the severity isn't properly shown, etc.This movie manages to mostly stay away from that. Is it 100% accurate? Of course not. It's still a Hollywood film. It's not a documentary. That being said, this does a better job than any other CF fiction I've ever seen. It includes a lot of the real things that CFers deal with: all our therapies, nebs, vesting, the ports, the G tubes, the o2, surgeries, the isolation, the survivor's guilt, and many others.A lot of people in the CF community have been up in arms about two CFers getting together despite the bacteria concerns. While I understand the hesitation, I personally know four couples where both spouses had/have CF (had because some have died). We need to look at this as a real situation because it is. There's a lot of isolation in CF, and reaching out to the only people on the planet who can truly understand you is only natural. As long as both people are consenting adults, know the risks, and go for it anyway, we need to respect that.I appreciate that this movie tackles both the reality of CF and the controversial subject of CFers breaking the six foot rule. This is a very real film, and not once did I feel offended or roll my eyes. Not 100% accurate, no, but I feel seen. I feel represented. Absolutely worth seeing, and i look forward to seeing it again.",

GOD must increase and we must decrease. This is a wonderful movie for all and a must see for everyone who wants to get a couple of pointers on life and what it's all about : )P.S. Love covers all",

Surprisingly, many of the characters are likeable, despite their profession and behaviour, and the director keeps the pace moving by never allowing the viewer to choose sides.\nThe story takes place within a 48-hour time period, lending a more frantic air to an already difficult situation. Great camera work and a lack of background music give the actors room to shine. Several scenes in the film allude to the situation at hand, characters speak as if the other person knows what they are talking about, just as in real life. Because, at times, the viewer is not clear, information has to be held on to, and meaning and impact become clear later. This is especially true of the ending.\nWhile there is plenty of action, and unpleasantly realistic at times, the film's strength is the pacing and subtle reveals.",

    "review": "Directors Cary and Darke have been exploring the world of professional football over the course of several films now. Never Walk Alone traced the evolution of a Broadway song to an anthem sung on English football terraces. Their last film, The Crazy Gang, traced the history of the now dissolved Wimbledon FC, and particularly their unexpected rise to the highest tier of football in the 1980s, playing a direct, unfashionable style. Where that film focuses on the strength of being outsiders, this documentary offers the flip-side of that experience, isolation and alienation.\nIn The Crazy Gang, we saw one of its architects, John Fashanu, in full-on self-promotion mode, mixing myth and reality to position himself as a 'hard-man' to rival his team-mate, and future film star, Vinnie Jones.\nIn Forbidden Games, we see a very different John, contrite, emotional, bordering on vulnerable as he remembers his broken relationship with his ill-fated older brother and fellow professional footballer Justin. John all-but disowned him when Justin came out as gay in the early 1990s, making him the only professional footballer to do so whilst still playing. The film tells his story, from Justin and John as orphaned brothers in the impossibly white Norfolk village of Shropham, through early success on the pitch with Norwich FC, to decline and his ultimate death in 1998, in auspicious circumstances. \nA generous budget has been furnished on the documentary, taken up by Netflix, and the directors take advantage of sweeping aerial camerawork, re-purposed photos and reconstructions of the Fashanu brothers' early life. It seems strange seeing Britain from an outsiders perspective, with titles stating things like 'London, England' throughout, which reminds us that this film is less about football but about the tortured life of an individual who never fully felt accepted, having been sent away from his parents as a boy, shunned by clubs because of his lifestyle choices and disowned by his little brother. Its an engrossing story, ultimately tragic, especially considering Justin is still a rarity, as a self-outed footballer. Despite the slight distraction of Hollywood-style visual techniques, Cary and Darke do well to let the story tell itself, with insightful, and subjective (even damaging) contributions from those who knew him.",

You get to see more and more, to stick some pieces together yet always pay attention on what's important, and this I do believe it is the beauty of a simpler movie: less is more.Sweetheart is an great example of how horror/survival/in the woods/ monster movie should present itself, not just copy this one, but come forward with the material after it was properly put together and gone through every little step. I salute Sweetheart and also recommend to you Prey (2019), tad bit alike, both decent add-ons to horror.Cheers!",

India is portrayed as a brutal country and if you are not wealthy or politically wired, you're existance is simply reduced to a waiting game with death as the end result.To sum it up in one phrase, this movie could be tagged; \"Dog eat dog.\" Other reviewers expressed their disgust at the protagonists methods for success. But I also bet they've never been poor, let alone poor in India.You can discuss ethics and morality from the comfort of your lounge room/home theatre all you want. It means nothing if you've never walked a mile in these people's shoes (and most don't even have those).It's not for everyone. But that doesn't mean it's a bad film. But it is certainly confronting.",

The huge, lifeless city sprawls on for ever with only a few humans surviving a meagre exist.I loved the premise of this film. The first half an hour is excellent and really immersed me into this juggernaut of a system that has gone runaway.Then some new characters appear with some very special talents. These newcomers \"break\" a lot of the world's set up and make the main characters survival seem a bit trivial.What really let this down for me was the pace. I am accustom to Eastern films having a more considered and careful approach and normally enjoy it. But here it feels like nothing happens for really long stretches at a time. Then when the action does start, someone pushes a button that fixes the situation. I feel this time could have been spent on more action or better characterisation.I enjoyed the bits I enjoyed very much, but feel it could have been condensed to a much, much shorter film.",

Anyway, it was enough to get me to write a first review here (not my last for sure). Directing was great... just enough style without being off putting. Characters were exceptional, as they spoke more through silence than dialogue, a lost art in today's world. While the acting was good or great even, across the board, special mention to the character Lee. Exceptional. Understated with depth and emotion. A fantastic performance!",

A storyline with so many plot twists could have been a canvas large enough to showcase a smart heist however it's all down the drain due to uninteresting screenplay, pathetic CGI (Need for Speed games have a better CGI and story), awful dubbing (you can actually see that the characters are speaking something else but the dubbing is entirely different) and bad action choreography. The director attempted a bold move by moving to an action genre after his debut movie which was a typical KJo level masala, but has miserably failed.Speaking about the efforts of actors, one can't review Jacqueline's performance because there ain't any. Sushant Singh had next to no scope in this one (all thanks to all the negatives mentioned above). Even stalwarts like Boman Irani and Pankaj Tripathi couldn't save the fall since their talent was badly used.Thank god this movie didn't see the light of theatres other wise, it would have been a waste of parts and audiences money.All in all, you can watch it if there's no better work to do. But if you do have something, then you can surely think to DRIVE pass this one without even a glimpse.",

When I was 6 years old I would get up every Sunday morning at 07.00 to see the latest Pokemon episode, and it was some of the happiest Sundays I spend watching, and because of that I was very nostalgic watching this movie.NOW FOR THE REVIEWWhat doesn't work: 1st off The movie is very fast paced, and because of that, some of the touching moments in this movie, some new, some recognizable doesn't really pay off.2nd The animation has some of the old style, but also some new style which doesn't come off great. One moment you're like: Wow, that's like the old days, and in another: ugh that's not good.3rd Because it rekindles some moments from the old days, you feel bad for the moments left out, which leaves you feeling a bit annoyed and cheated.4th Team rocket is utterly wasted in this movie. They could have left them out, but they kept them for comic relief, which was a HUEEGE MISTAKE! WHAT A WASTE!5th It's not for hardcore Pokemon fans. If you're deep into Pokemon new gens and hate the old stuff, this will leave you unsatisfied and feeling like they f**ked the community over.What works:1st off The movie is a mix of nostalgia and new gen Pokemon's and characters, and they actually made it work. Kudos.2nd. If you are anything like me, an OG Pokemon fan and a bit of a GENWUNNER, this is gonna be pure nostalgia love-fest. Right off the bat you're taken back to pallet town and you know where this is headed, nostalgia adventures. You get to see some old legendary encounters and some heartfelt moments, which sweetens this roller-coaster ride.3rd. We finally gets some closure an in depth story regarding ash an Ho- Oh. The chapter I waited for so long as a kid is finally here.A MUST WATCH for GENWUNNERS and people who are nostalgic for the old seasons.It gets a 6/10 and a +1 for nostalgia.On a last and more serious note. This could have been a 9/10 Pokemon if they made it an hour longer. That would have allowed them to slow it down, focus on story and would have made the heartfelt moments pay off more than they did.",

    "plot": "I enjoyed the series very much but a major case of historical disinformation bothered me. The series highlights the visit to South Africa in 1947 of the future Queen Elizabeth II, with her sister, Princess Margaret, and her parents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. The visit lasted three months and involved a train journey through South Africa itself, Southern Rhodesia, Swaziland, Basutoland and the Bechuanaland Protectorate. Racial division between the crowds cheering the royal family on their journey is shown in many scenes. For instance black and white well-wishers are seen to cheer the royal family from two sides of the royal train, possibly because they are standing on segregated platforms. This situation is then ascribed to Afrikaner Nationalism and apartheid. The problem with this explanation is that the National Party, representing Afrikaner Nationalism and apartheid, only came to power in 1948, the year after 1947 when the royal family visited South Africa. In 1947 and in the preceding years South Africa was ruled by general Jan Smuts of the South African Party. He was a great friend of Great Britain who acted as adviser to the British War Cabinet. It was probably partly due to the military support and advisory role of Gen Smuts in the Second World War that South Africa was chosen as the country where the royal family would spend all those sunny months. One can see Gen Smuts in many scenes in the documentary. In other words, the documentary does not show South Africa under the rule of Afrikaner Nationalism or apartheid, but under the rule of Gen Smuts, before the word apartheid became generally known in the world. A second aspect of what seems like disinformation is that exactly the same kind of racial separation and inequality existed in all of the other colonial possessions of Great Britain visited by the royal family, i.e. Southern Rhodesia, Swaziland, Basutoland and the Bechuanaland Protectorate. Britain had colonies all over Africa at the time, including for instance the present-day Ghana and Kenya. In all of these countries you would have seen similar scenes of racial separation in 1947. These scenes were explained by British colonialism, not by racial laws not yet enacted by a government not yet in power in South Africa. There is no excuse for any kind of racial domination, let alone inhumanity shown to any race, and the National Party justly disappeared from history, together with its policies. But we should not be misinformed and certainly not dis-informed by portrayals of history.",

Ignore the terrible acting, and immerse yourself in this floating narration backed by a lovely soundtrack. The core of Theeram is romance, but there's more to the story than coyness and unspoken words. It's about an unfair world where things are not always hunky-dory, and our protagonists here learn it the hard way. It is a well-written film but is dampened by a dismal lead performance and a nasty final 10 minutes. Theeram could have been a tighter film had Arafath used more talented actors, but it still is a palpable dish to try out if you like appreciating newbies. TN.",

    "review": "Oddly enough, then \"Shanghai Fortress\" had managed to stay under my radar, and it wasn't before I was browsing through the movies on Netflix that it happened to pop up.I was immediately interested in watching the movie, given the synopsis and also because it starred Shu Qi.First of all, then it should be said that the storyline written by Jiang Nan wasn't exactly rocket science. This was pretty much generic to the core. It was everything you could and would expect from a sci-fi action movie of this type, for better or worse. Well, at least you know what you are getting yourself into when you sit down to watch \"Shanghai Fortress\". This is hardly a movie that sets new milestones or move existing borders.That being said, then I will move straight on to saying that while the storyline was generic and predictable, then the movie was actually quite entertaining and enjoyable, nonetheless.The visual department really upped their game in this movie. And it was such a visual treat to sit down and watch the CGI effects in \"Shanghai Fortress\", and I think this is actually the first Chinese movie I have seen that have put on this type of grand display usage of CGI. It was marvelous and it really carried the movie a lot of the way, given the shortcomings of the storyline and script.They had some fairly nicely talented actors and actresses on the cast list. I wasn't familiar with the most of them, which actually is a nice thing for me, as I enjoy seeing new talents and not associate their faces with previously played roles and characters. But for, I must admit, then it was Shu Qi that had the spotlight in \"Shanghai Fortress\". I have been a fan of hers for a long, long time and she was good in this movie, though it wasn't her best performance in her career.All in all, if you enjoy a good old fashioned alien invasion movie, then give \"Shanghai Fortress\" a chance. I enjoyed it from start to end, and I am rating the movie a solid six out of ten stars.",

    "review": "It has been a while since Bollywood has churned good thriller films. Films like Kahaani, Manorama-Six Feet Under, Error 404 or Phobia had a good twist which will remain embedded in your memories. Will Ittefaq be able to create enough tension to keep audience at bay ? let us find out ..Ittefaq tells the story of 2 suspects (Siddharth Malhotra and Sonakshi Sinha) who are involved in a murder leading to 2 different stories that happened one night. The investigating officer (Akshaye Khanna) must be find out which story holds the fact.First time director, Abhay Chopra, follows the foot-step of 1969's Ittefaq directed Yash Chopra but introduces his own world. The film has a pretty solid opening scenes involving car chases and the confrontation between Siddharth Malhotra and Sonakshi Sinha. The film adds more flavor with Akshaye Khanna entering the scene and taking the charge of murder. The director does a fine job in building tension when two victims tell their own version of stories. In second half, you will be convinced with the suspect and while everything is about to end well, there will be another twist in the end which is unconvincing and fails to keep the momentum. This is where director could have created more impact with crisp editing and interesting plot. As a first timer, Abhay Chopra does a fine job but is mowed down by loose second half. Screenplay is good but suffers towards the climax. Better writing would have helped. Cinematography is just about okay while the background is decent (should be good in thriller films). Siddharth Malhotra does well as Vikram Sethi and emotes his expression better than his previous films. Sonakshi Sinha is wooden. It is Akshay Khanna who steals the show with his upright performance. He infuses humor in his character and is even speaks serious tone when investigating the complex case.Overall, a fair attempt to show the double murder but is saddened by the weak spot. Decent 2.75 / 5",

The film faithfully chronicles a true story... perhaps too faithfully for the faint of heart to watch. This finely acted film, which must have been excruciating for the actors to work on, is a must-see for its historical value, not for casual amusement (there's nothing amusing about sadism, unless you're a Nazi). The recreation of scenes the real photographer captured is amazing for their detailed accuracy, and the film brilliantly brings the images, originally captured in black and white, to life. I rated this film an \"8\", which I deem a very high rating, only because production values were not of top-notch calibre... but, then, they really didn't need to be for this film. The setting, along with the acting, was perfectly believable as is, and you'll be sucked into a nightmare as soon as the film begins... and stay there until the last few minutes. That alone makes this film a huge success.",

While the critics were \"eye rolling\" and complaining of how slow it was moving, i was walking through an art gallery, lingering on moments captured beautifully in the B&W landscape.It is a simple tale told with minimal dialogue primarily through imagery, with beauty, poignancy, grief, the playful innocence of the girls they once were, the elemental power of giving birth, among other things. The archetype images of the first Goddess in her aspects of Maiden, Mother, Crone across the three acts. The erotic scenes so pooh-poohed by the critics were also staged with poetic metaphors of the Feminine spiritual principle of Nature.",

    "review": "BAD SEEDS, GOOD VIBES\nOnce in a while a movie comes along that speaks to you.\nSometimes, it's a big, important movie like The Godfather or quiet important movie like Howard's End.And sometimes, it is just the right movie at the right time. In 1978, my wife and I went to see a movie and it was sold out, so we looked at what other movies we could see and for unknown reasons we selected a French comedy because I recognized one of the actor's name - Ugo Tognazzi. The movie was La Cage aux Folles. If you have never seen the original French movie, give yourself a New Year's present, see it.Forty years later, lightning struck again, but this time surfing the innumerable choices on TV with my sister, looking for anything that wasn't about sadistic murderers or alien invasions. And, viola! There was Mauvaises Herbes or Bad Seeds, another French movie, this time taking place in Paris instead of Nice and on Netflix instead of a movie theatre. What drew us in was its female lead, Catherine Deneuve, looking every bit as beautiful as she has always been, but a beauty tempered by time and experience.The story was simple - she and a thirty-ish Arab refugee, Wael, (Kheiron who also wrote and directed) have a neat scam that trades on people's prejudices about elderly woman and immigrants. When they get caught, it's not by the cops, but by an old male acquaintance of Deneuve's who threatens to turn them into the police unless they help him. He runs a summer program for 'bad seeds', six problem teens who are close to dropping out of school.Wael becomes their teacher and his first challenge is to get the kids to speak - they have banned together, promising not to say a word. Wael solves this problem ingeniously then goes on to teach the wayward teens lessons in life.Interspersed with this story is the story of a small boy in an unstated Arab country that is being torn apart by violence. His family is murdered and he has to live on the streets. How he does that and how he gets brought to an orphanage run by nuns is the parallel story from the boy's point of view.Add into the mix a corrupt cop, a story of autumnal love, a neat trick to getting an attractive girl's phone number, six troubled but fascinating teens and just the right amount of menace and mayhem - and Viola!Just as forty years ago, I was left with a warm glow that made me think not all is Trumpian gloom, that there is a way to find a life both fulfilling and sustainable, that the good, by adapting itself to this crooked world, can prevail.",

He started out doing dirty tricks for Nixon; he made his money as a lobbyist for some terrible governments; now he's a confidant of Donald Trump. In a healthy society, Stone (and any politican who worked with him) would be shunned. This account of his story is consistently fascianting, and a tale of much of what has gone wrong with American politics.And yet, although the documentary is critical in tone, I suspect Stone loves it. A man who revels in his own notoriety, he is given plenty of screen time to speak for himself; while numerous others, friend and foe alike, take turns to testify to his evil genius. For anyone who dislikes the man, there's plenty of grist to the mill here. But how do you shame the shameless? Not, perhaps, by allowing them to star what is essentially a 90 minute promo vehicle. The real tragedy is less that people like Stone exist; but that we allow them to polllute the public space.",

    "review": "After I stopped, I read all the reviews to see if I should keep going, and so some of my comments are prompted by those.I apologise for not finishing the movie and still writing a review. I know that's not really fair, but I just couldn't take it anymore and when I read the reviews it seems my problem with the movie wasn't going to go away. I would have persevered if the reviews had been different. Especially as my bar for watching was pretty low since I'm practicing my Spanish comprehension and am watching anything halfway decent as an educational exercise.I don't think I had an issue with the main character and her cohort being marriage-obsessed. I get that some women are, regardless of the culture they're from. I get that some cultures are very marriage-obsessed and the pressure on any woman after she turns 20 or 21 to get married before she becomes unmarriageable and worthless is real. I wasn't conscious that this was an impediment to my enjoyment of the movie. I enjoy a lot of movies from cultures that aren't mine, with viewpoints that aren't mine.Unlike some other reviewers, I thought the acting was good - very good. The main actor, Cassandra Ciangherotti, did a great job portraying a very real character. She has an element of Kristen Wiig about her - awkward, funny, very mobile and expressive face. She was completely believable as Ana. I'm going to see what else she's in.The problem was that I hated Ana. I would have found her selfish, fake, narcissistic, unpleasant, and immature had she been 13 years old. For a character who is supposedly in her late 20s, she's unbearable. She's awful to family, friends, everyone -- and refuses to see it. I thought this movie would be about how the shock of a breakup caused real introspection and growth, but 1 hour and 6 minutes into it I saw no evidence this was happening.Instead of becoming a better and more mature human being, she just kept getting worse. Ana was so bad that the relationship with the good guy she meets is entirely unbelievable - why on earth does he fall in love with her? What can they possibly talk about? They have nothing in common. What does she have to offer any intelligent, adult man (or anyone)? There is nothing to Ana except her self-absorption and obsession with doing anything it takes to get married.TL;DR - The main character (not the actress) is an awful human being and I feel like her awfulness was cross-cultural.",

Many of my fellow students who are intelligent and successful oftentimes have trouble with communication and interpersonal skills, and some of their parents even have them take classes on learning how to interact with others. Our generation has come to a point where society pushes the need for perfection up our throats for so long we forget that it their and hurting many people's mental and physical condition. This movie draws attention to these issues in a lighthearted way that remains relevant. I recommend watching this just to gain an understanding of the stress, pressure, and hard work many high school students must do in order to gain \"success\".",

    "plot": "Diane Kruger appears as an interviewee in this documentary. Although it is not mentioned during the film, Kruger was at the time preparing to produce a TV miniseries biopic on the life of Hedy Lamarr, with Kruger herself starring as Lamarr. The biopic was to be an adaptation of the 2012 biography Hedy's Folly: The Life and Breakthrough Inventions of Hedy Lamarr, The Most Beautiful Woman in the World by Richard Rhodes. All three projects (the Rhodes book, the documentary \"Bombshell,\" and the development of the screenplay for Kruger's miniseries) were awarded grants by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, a philanthropic organization that normally supports science and technology experiments and endeavors.",
    "review": "I mentioned that the documentary was even-handed because all too often, I've seen biographies of various celebrities which either only focus on the bad or only the good about folks. Folks have positive and negative qualities...and Hedy Lamarr is no exception.The film is a biography of the actress that also focuses on her inventing the concept of rotating frequencies...enabling a sub, for example, to launch a radio-guided torpedo without worries about the enemy jamming the signal. It's a strange invention for an actress to have made...and the film helps to show that Lamarr was not just a pretty face. It also, sadly, talks about her personal life...which was filled with husband and husband and disappointment after disappointment. And, it talks about Lamarr's drug use (created by the studio) and her odd personality quirks. All put together, it makes for an intriguing look at a fascinating lady. Well worth seeing...and a nice film about a feminist in 1930s-40s Hollywood.",

    "review": "\"Happy as Lazzaro\" feels like a parable with hints of magical realism, and the whole thing was just a bit too obtuse for me to fully enjoy.There are themes of social repression, economic exploitation, and mankind's abandonment of nature for the more soulless landscapes of urban industrialization, all of which are certainly relevant to the world in which we live. But I found myself hard pressed to feel involved in any of it as explored by this film. Lazzaro is more an idea than an actual character, and I think one of the reasons he's offered as such a blank slate is so that the audience can project on to him whatever they want. I imagine there will be all sorts of different interpretations of this film, who Lazzaro is, and what it is he's meant to signify. I can and have expended that kind of mental energy on answering questions in other movies, and usually enjoy it very much, but I have to feel like the questions are going to be worth answering before I can get my head in that zone, and I didn't with this movie.Grade: B",

It makes me think of other honest movies about American families like Crooklyn, Ordinary People or Kramer vs Kramer.\nIn this year of 2020 the word struggle comes up time and again, but let's not forget another truly American symbolic word .... perseverance.

    "plot": "The movie is adapted from the novel \"Finally I Get You\" written by Lan Bai Se.",
    "review": "At its core, 'This is Not What I Expected' is about two diametrically opposite individuals who start off butting heads with each other but end up falling in love. On one hand is Lu Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro), the CEO of a multibillion international company called VN Group who flies around the world evaluating hotels for their worthiness before deciding whether to acquire them or not. On the other is Gu Shengnan (Zhou Dongyu), a junior sous-chef at the boutique hotel Rosebud in Shanghai where Lu Jin and his subservient assistant Richard Meng (Sun Yizhou) has just checked into for business (not pleasure, mind you). It isn't just their statuses that are different; their personalities are just as dissimilar \u2013 Lu Jin is a tightly wound, clinical individual who prides himself at being a perfectionist; whereas Shengnan is by and large a free-wheeling lark whose blithe attitude to life is only disturbed by her recent breakup with the hotel's\u00a0\u00a0(douche-bag) general\u00a0manager Cheng Zixian (a very suave-looking Tony Yang). As much as scriptwriters Li Yuan and Xu Yimeng draw from the oldest trick in the rom-com playbook, their adaptation of renowned web novelist Lan Bai Se's 'A Long Time Coming' is no means stale. Oh no, the result is quite the contrary in fact. Mixing the familiar elements of an 'opposites attract' rom-com with the ingredients of a culinary comedy has proved quite the inspiration, and even if it does feel familiar on the whole, there's no denying that veteran editor Derek Hui's directorial debut still tastes fresh, delightful and often hilarious. Benefiting immensely from his years working with some of the best in the industry including Peter Chan himself, Teddy Chan and even Chen Kaige, Hui demonstrates confidence, discipline and clarity right from the get-go, displaying none of the shortcomings that usually plague first-time directors. That is clear right from the get-go: within the prologue, he establishes succintly not only Lu Jin's exacting standards in the food he eats, but also the businesslike approach with which he handles staff performance, telling an under-performing senior manager seated across a long table that he is fired. And then without letting up, Hui stages the first meet-cute between Lu Jin and Shengnan in a classic case of mistaken identity, as the former catches the latter vandalizing the hood of his car to avenge her heartbroken female buddy Xu Zhaodi (Meng Xi) and only agrees not to call the police after she lets him humiliate her, i.e. by writing on her forehead the telephone number of the company she is supposed to call to fix the damage she caused to his car. Oh yes, there is a precision to the way Hui approaches his scenes, such that each makes its point without outlasting its welcome. That same exactness also ensures the movie remains pacey \u2013 from the point Lu Jin steps into the Rosebud criticizing the customer service, room soundproofing and Michelin-starred food in turn; to his enchantment with the last-minute dish prepared by Shengnan and each one of her exquisitely plated dishes thereafter; to the series of encounters between Lu Jin and Shengnan that reinforce his annoyance towards her before he discovers she is the chef he has been enamored with; and last but not least to the pranks he plays on her before she realizes that he already knows her identity.There is plenty of screwball humour in between, and before the madcap antics turn repetitive, the second half switches gears for intimacy and even pathos. Over a nicely edited montage, we see Lu Jin turning up unannounced at Shengnan's messy but homely apartment where she lives with her dog named 'Boss', treating her as his personal chef, turning her place into his own home, and in the process discovering a much more human side to himself that he has been repressing. There is both sweetness and tenderness in a whimsical sequence where both hallucinate rain after having some poisonous blowfish for steamboat, and end up taking an umbrella out for a walk around the neighbourhood and on board a bus through Shanghai's beautifully lit streets. A late twist that sees Lin Chiling emerge as Lu Jin's personal chef is somewhat under-developed, but still makes the point of reinforcing how food has been a special bond between their hearts. And as a final note, it is admirable that Hui stays true to the quirks and eccentricities of his characters as well as their relationship during the heartfelt finale. That same consistency extends to Takeshi Kaneshiro and Zhou Dongyu's performances, so that we not only believe that their characters are authentic but are also invested emotionally in them. True to its title, 'This is Not What I Expected' is an unexpectedly enjoyable rom-com \u2013 the jokes land mostly where they should, the romance is sweet but never cloying, and the presentation is brisk, lively and engaging. It also boasts a pair of leads with sharp comic timing and great chemistry that you'll miss hanging out with the minute it's over, and with the venerable Peter Ho-sun Chan and his regular partner Jojo Hui as producers, you can be assured of a finale that is touching, poignant and genuine. Just be sure not to go into it hungry, because the wonderfully delectable food porn shots within will make sure that it isn't just your heart that will be stirred.",

    "review": "It is my belief that this film is not intended to be one \"based on a true story\", not a factual tale. I sincerely did not look up as to what happened on the set of Casablanca I doubt that most of what is depicted on-screen happened, but the film should be interpreted rather as a sort of reinvention, a dramatization. Thus, explained the reason for the b/w coloring: it reminds the viewer that this is not real, that it's a film. The only colour seen is the red of the \"On air\" light when shootings are rolling, as to suggest that those moments that we don't ever see are more real. Yet, we never actually see cameras rolling in those scenes, we don't see but the fictional story presented to us.\nThe story incorporates a great deal of classic hollywood nostalgia, some nods to the practices that the metoo movement nowadays rightfully criticises. Ferenc Lengyel shares a damning resemblance to Michael Curtiz. His character is not presented as a positive figure, in my opinion, nor an auteur. He is a corporate director, he doesn't write the script or has creative freedom, and the film presents him in such terms.\nThe whole movie is encompassed by some very stunning noir cinematography, several continuous takes, it's a feast for the eye.\nThe language is mostly english, often spoken by hungarian actors, so in some cases you can hear the accent. It's not too much of a con for me, but I wanted to notify it.\nThis is Topolanszky's first full-lenght feature. As a debut, it is quite remarkable. I'm interested in seeing more of him.",

Although originated from what can be known as a \"B-rated\" market - Thailand, the product - what may have been seen as a typical teenager movie - stands out in its own field with brilliant production and composing. I came in the cinema with almost zero hope for what could be the next definition of modern entertainment movie, yet the show proved that it got all the elements ready. The casts, while still in their early years, depicts the characters as-what-they-are, with enough depth and individuality. Next,the surprisingly excellent screenplay, cinematic sound and effects took every single breath away. In short, what's here is a play inside a play, a concert inside a movie. The photography skill here was taken to the next level. The sound team was truly praiseworthy. No one expected how intriguing a simple exam scene could be until they see the pencils were dropped while Mozart notes are stepping in the beautifully shot frames. No second was left out or wasted, scene after scene followed one another like the flow of water, with all the intensity a film this kind needed. What's next? What's there left behind? - The viewers are left with the question thorough the play and were not disappointed. Could this be the all time classic for generations? Hardly, but could this piece of art here linger in your thoughts, days after days? Certainly. It was all too simple at first look, until the drama started: the thought-consuming piano flow kicked in and the clock started moving, seconds by seconds.",

The story, while repetitive at times, does a great job telling the story to the viewer, providing an easily understood story of David's personal life, his life as a promising new director, and his families unfortunate end. But as I said before, the only slight drawback is that it often repeats itself when telling the story. And we will discuss it.The film jumps around between David's personal life, his work on the film, and his murder. The issue is SOMETIMES, the story repeats itself when starting a new section. I found myself thinking that the film already explained that he was a potentially great film maker, feeling that the film repeats its to remind you of things that didn't happen too long ago for me to forget and need to be reminded. I would have also liked to hear more about his murder, which I found to be an interesting plot line that wasn't fleshed out as much as I would of hoped. But I must emphasize that these are only minor issues.Over all I would recommend the film to anyone, though some may find it to be too conspiracy theory laden, but as an avid documentary viewer, I enjoyed it.",

The actors are mostly good, Suyodhana/Duryodhana is the best of the lot and makes you think twice about the preconceived notions about his evil nature, and instead makes you feel bad for him. I can't think of another mythology being dissected and explained in a manner like this. This is a binge watch. Wish there was another season. The writers deserve an award.",

    "plot": "The director Fellipe Barbosa had access to the photographs taken by the camera that was found along with Gabriel Buchmann's body.\nWith those photographs, Buchmann's notebook and e-mails sent to his family and friends, he could track down the places the tourist visited as well as the people he met. He also found some characters through Facebook.",
    "review": "Main character, Gabriel, travels through Africa. The opening sequence of the film is beautiful, stunning. The film starts with the discovery of his body; therefore his death, the fact that you know he will die on an African mountain looms over the rest of the film. Gabriel is played well, the viewer gets to know all sides of his personality. He tries to avoid 'tourist traps' and travel as cheap and sustainable as possible, making contact and blending in with the locals. The visit of his girlfriend adds an interesting element to the film in my opinion, their relationship and (how her presence influences) his travels provide food for thought.Authentic, a lot of the characters (seem to) play themselves, multiple languages are used and I believe it was shot in the original locations. However, it felt very long for 127 minutes, some conversations and scenes are just tedious. I felt like there was too much dialogue at times, balance was lost here and there. But overall a very beautiful film which does a good job and capturing the essence of backpacking and the challenges a traveller faces. Highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys films such as Into The Wild.",

So why would a mother send her child from the US to Nigeria, in his formative years???Moreover, if the mother cares so deeply about her Nigerian roots, how come she has no idea how old her nephew is, or what he does?

    "review": "When I watched \"HERO\" I just loved it. I fell love with the worldbuilding and the colorful settings and the choreographes were one of a kind. So, \"Ying\" comes out and it really looks different. I tried to avoid any advertsiment and I went blind. The result... \"Ying\" is worth watching, although it has its flaws I guess.\nLet's start with the good news:\nThe cinematography is something you must... experience. I like that the whole film is driven by the ying and yiang symbol and it's a black and white film without being black and white. Both the production and the costume design is impeccable and even the ones who hate such stylish films ought to show a bit of respect for the work done. Almost every shot can be used as a wallpaper and although some shots were bleak or fake, the film's presentation is one of a kind.\nThe souundtrack is also great. The instrument used provokes a lot of emotion and I actually felt that the sound editing and mixing were used in a unique way. The music speaks for itself and creates a weird but interesting tone.\nThe battle sequences and the training were both expertly shot and the choreograhy was great and never felt too pretentious.\nAs for the script... it's good... but not my thing. I actually felt that the script wasn't sure about where it was going. It's like a liitle it of everything and I cannot say I was connected with the story. I still don't know what it wanted to be...\nWhat I made about it was that it tried to illustrate how it is quite impossible to have a ying and a yang and find balance and peace. Thing will always be shacky and it also illustrated the games of power and grid and how everone will do anything for power. I loved the action sequences and the script was a nice of writing, but the dynamics and the character arcs were never 10/10 so that I could be fully into it.\nThe acting is overall good, it's just that Chao Deng played both the potagonist, who is a silent force and the old man, who is a crazy maniac and even if he did handle the 2 different roles pretty good I felt that he overacted while playing the old man. It was probably froced, but I just hateit when they are overacting.\nOverall, this film is good. It is brillliantly shot , the technical aspects are almost perfect and a lot of choices in the story were clever and differed the movie from silly blockbusters or cliches. A good, stylish, Chinese watch with characters always seeking for acceptance and longing for power. Its impressive shots and great visual direction are what making this film a good watch and are the reason why I am giving it an 8/10. It's closer to a seven than to a nine, but an 8 will do.",

It stars Ryu Seung-ryong, Shim Eun-kyung, Park Jung-min, Kim Min-jae and Jung Yu-mi. The film was written and directed by Yeon Sang-ho (who also performed both duties on the 2016 critically acclaimed 'zombies on a train' flick 'TRAIN TO BUSAN'), and it was released by Netflix through it's streaming site. I really enjoyed it. The story is about a bank security guard, named Shin Seok-heon (Seung-ryong), who has a troubled relationship with his estranged daughter, Shin Roo-mi (Eun-kyung). He drinks some contaminated water from a mountain spring, and gains super telekinetic powers. He tries to use these powers to help his daughter, who is constantly being harassed by a corrupt construction company. Seok-heon becomes a reluctant superhero in the process. The film is the first ever South Korean superhero movie, and it's definitely a refreshing change from the American ones (like the new 'AVENGERS'). This film has so much character, and genuine heart and emotion. It's pretty simple in it's action scenes, and villainous threat, which is what's so cool about it as well. The film concentrates on what a good superhero movie should be about, rather than on CGI and other superficial excesses. I really found it to be quite entertaining and effective.",

    "review": "Fe de Etarras is a dark humor movie directed by Basque director Borja Cobeaga. The movie was released in 2017 as a Netflix Original and was the second Spanish movie to stream on the platform. It takes place during a hot summer on a small town in Spain which is no mentioned. Four members of the Basque terrorist organization, ETA, plan on leaving their mark while Spain's national soccer team makes its way to the finals of the world cup. However, they must wait for a phone call that will give them permission to carry on with their plan. As they wait for the phone call, they try to stay away from people to hide their identity and face many funny situations that add comedy to the movie.\nHaving a good understanding of Basque history and recognizing the ETA is essential to understanding this movie. It is based on real life history and social acts that go back in time. Basque language and music are used throughout the movie to express the essence of the contemporary culture. Part of the comedy is the classic Basque vs. the rest of Spain social situation. The movie is dark humor and touched topics about racism between countries. If people find this uncomfortable, they should not watch the movie. Being a soccer fan really adds to the experience of the movie because it creates its own version of the 2010 World Cup.\nIn general, the movie is really good and suitable for a mature audience. The characters are well built; however, the director shows very little information about their past which I think could have been done better. If you enjoy dark humor and are familiar with Spanish history, this is a movie that you might enjoy. Enjoying with some friends will definitely enhance the experience.",

    "review": "It's not the most original story. It borrows heavily from Solaris, 2001, Star Trek, Sunshine, Strange Days, The Abyss... But the hate it gets is pretty ROFL worthy. I didn't understand why at first, until i understood that this series replaced the ultimately forgettable (yet seemingly more popular) \"The Expanse\". I love Sci-Fi, but honestly, all the reviews rating this below 5, you can just disregard them. IMDB should stop letting every opiniated crybaby write a review and figure out a way to filter out the petty fanboy drivel. It also seems a lot of these people did not watch the show, like they claimed to have, since they are bringing up issues, which are actually explained in the story. But as it stands, Nightflyers is rated a lot lower than shows many times worse, such as Killjoys, Dark Matter or Continuum and other cheesefests. This show is leagues better than those, yet gets rated a lot worse.Back to the show. The setting works, eventhough it's not original (as stated above), characters and performances are better than most sci-fi series, there is enough mystery, to keep you interested without dragging it all out (like The Expanse). There are a few things that don't make sense, but ultimately don't detract from the experience, unless you have set your bar to the standard of the absolute best shows of the past few decades. If you let those things bother you, then you can stop watching about 95% of movies and shows all together.It's a well made show, i enjoyed watching it, but does not break any new ground. If you liked the movies/shows i mentioned earlier, and wouldn't mind a \"light-synthesis\" version of those (content & storywise), then you might very well enjoy this.",

    "plot": "Featured in 60 Minutes: Pope Francis/At the Zoo (2018)",
    "review": "\"Pope Francis: A Man of His Word\" (2018 release; 95 min.) is a documentary about Pope Francis. As the movie opens, we are introduced to the thinking of St. Francis of Assisi, an Italian friar active in the late 12th/early 13th century. We then shift to \"Buenos Aires, 1999\" as the then-Archbishop addresses a crowd, and just as quickly we move to \"St. Peter's Square, 2013\", when the conclave elects Pope Francis. We are reminded that the pope is the first to take Francis as his papal name (to honor St. Francis of Assisi), the first pope from the Americas and the southern hemisphere, and the first Jesuit pope. We then settle in to hear from Pope Francis. \"Listen a lot, and speak just enough\" seems to be the Pope's M.O. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from celebrated German documentarian Wim Wenders. Here he gets all-access to the Pope (and indeed the movie was made with full cooperation of the Vatican). Please note that this is NOT a biography of the Pope. In fact, we learn nothing about his background, other than being an Archbishop in Buenos Aires in the late 90s. As it turns out, the movie plays mostly as a private one-on-one discussion, one could even say, sermon by the Pope on a wide variety of topics, including poverty, social justice, the 'culture of waste', empathy towards others, our limited time on this earth, etc., but also some touchy ones such as the sex scandals that have plagued the Catholic church for decades now, and his position on gays and lesbians (by coincidence, today's headline-making news that the Pope tells a gay person \"God made you like that and loves you like that\" is not a new development and merely affirms what the Pope says in this documentary). Interestingly, the Pope also emphasizes the importance of a smile and a sense of humor (the Pope confesses that each day after his morning prayer, he reads Sir Thomas More's \"Prayer For Good Humor\"). Please note that you do NOT have to be a Catholic to come away from this film with something meaningful. To me, Pope Francis is a symbol of humility and HOPE. \"The future has a name, and it is Hope\", the Pope reminds us. Yes, Pope Francis may be a man of his word, but even more, he is a man of action, and in that sense, his life itself is a sermon.\"Pope Francis - A Man of His Word\" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely (mostly seniors I might add). When the Pope talks directly into the camera (which is most of the time), it feels like he addresses you, and hence not surprisingly, one could hear a pin drop on the theater during much of the movie. If you have any interest in Pope Francis, you can count your blessings with this outstanding documentary. \"Pope Francis - A Man of His Word\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",

I am afraid that the time pass movie goers may complain of boredom and classify this movie a documentary. Nevertheless they may still look at others watching the movie to check if they are alone thinking that they way.Nawazuddin Siddiqui is promisingly the best actor ...sorry the writer. I had to change from actor to a writer because I am still not able to get the Munto out of him.Art work and sound recording is brilliant!! For some reason I felt the cigarette lighting with a match stick sounded so perfect I felt that it's been some decades since I heard that sound. Same with the sound of the type writer and the ruffle of the paper.If you are movie lover who loves to analyse every scene go to the movie. If you land up into this movie because other movies are sold out, you won't be sold on entertainment!! Jingoistic expectations will be laid to rest right from scene 1.I can rate this movie because it will berate someone who will call Priceless!!",

That's the torturous state of being this film encapsulates and does it with purpose. At times, the cinema language gets more experimental than necessarily to accomplish its goal, but I commend the director for pushing the boundaries of standard filmmaking and letting us inhabit Van Gogh's mind for this brief period.

    "review": "What plays out as a drama for the first hour, turns into an uncomfortable thriller, as a down on her luck teacher takes a special interest in a young bright student who has a knack for creating poems far beyond his age. Not seeing a trailer and knowing next to nothing before tuning in, there's never really a key as to where the film is going, both in structure and intention. It keeps you on your toes but it also creates more and more tension and a cringey feeling in your stomach when Maggie Gyllenhaal's 'Lisa' makes each move to get closer to her student. It's icky and both depressing how far she goes to make herself feel accomplished and worth something. So in that sense, this is a fascinating character study of psycho teacher, who just happens to also be incredibly kind and giving.7.5/10",

    "plot": "Adapted from the manga series \"Itazura na Kiss\" by Tada Kaoru.",
    "review": "It took me a long time to get around to watching this Taiwanese version of the same drama I have seen as Korean and Japanese versions. The first one I watched was called Playful Kiss (K-drama) and the Japanese version is called Mischievous Kiss. Miss in Kiss is an odd title, which I don't get. The poster you see on Netflix shows the 2 main characters, but it is such a dorky looking shot. You would think the poster would go more out of its way to make them look better. They are better looking than that.This is a story that builds up over 6 years. A high school girl has a crush on the class genius. He seems very aloof and rejects her as she tries to hand a letter of confession to him. Then, a while later, her home is destroyed in a hurricane and she ends up living with the genius and his family, along with her dad.The mother of the genius loves this girl and wants her son to marry her before he is 20. The mother got a fortune read when he was a baby and was told he would become a monk if he didn't marry by the age of 20.Each episode is up or down. The genius is coming of age trying to find what his passion is. He can do anything with his smarts. Other people are trying to get him to go into this or that field.The girl never wavers for her feelings for him. If he is nice to her, she is thrilled. If he is mean to her or is with another girl, she is miserable.One thing that got on my nerves throughout is the girl's whiny, baby voice. Every time she screws up, she acts like a baby. That said, I did watch the whole thing.The Japanese version has a sequel called Mischievous Kiss in Tokyo. I haven't seen that but I might soon.",

    "review": "This movie could be compared to Blue is the Warmest Color but this is way better. It does include some of the same things as that movie but this movie actually makes you feel something and in a way it's relatable to any relationship or how we should go about our love life. I also love how raw this movie is like this felt like I was right there in that moment. Great movie. Alia Shawkat you've really outdone yourself and I hope you continue making movies.",

    "plot": "Han Seo Yun (played by Park Ji Yeon from Imitation) dreams of being a model, but she always seems to fall a little bit short ~ She's simply not tall enough. She hasn't given up yet, though. At a tryout where top models are the judges, she encounters supermodel & judge Na Jin Wook (Kim Dong Ho from Undercover). He seems to think it's his job to yank off the bandaid - he tells her to give up. She'll never be a model. Not unless she grows a few inches. Seo Yun is devastated. Later that evening her friends are consoling her at the karaoke bar while he, at the same time and place, has been dragged out with his friends for some karaoke.Then things go sideways. They both end up on the roof when a big jolt of lightning strikes. Just like that and flash: Body switch! She's been a fan of his for a long time. He has nothing but disdain for her, but they'll have to work together so that neither ruins their respective lives. She's going to have to be a model - a male model. He has to go to school and take tests. No one can understand why Jin Wook is now taking orders from a HS girl. They must quickly figure out a way to 'undo the done'.Quite coincidentally, my \"watch roulette\" landed on a string of shows dealing with appearance and/or body swapping. Listed in order of low to high quality, I ended up watching MR in tandem with these shows: Abyss-4.7 (plenty of good elements and promise, but It ultimately fails miserably) 200 lb Beauty-6.5 (excellent elements but they fail to fashion it tightly & neatly) The Miracle-7.7 (great for tweens & older: It's excellent), and now this. It's a common device that is useful for putting our mind and emotions inside of another person. Also a common theme in anime, it's a look from a new perspective.The leads scorch this runway. These kids can act. He has to play a teenage girl, and she has to play a man. And they do it very well. Watching her, in his body, interact with her girlfriend is particularly funny. Sometimes laugh out loud funny. In the USA we have some fantastic actors, without a doubt, but we have many more personalities. It's not a criticism, it is merely factual. For example, I have loved watching Ray Liotta ever since the 1986 movie Something Wild with Melanie Griffith. Regardless of the feature, he seems to only play: Ray Liotta. He's just one of many - actors who deliver delight with every moment on screen largely by playing identical roles. The point is that Hollywood's a little bit out of balance when it comes to personalities vs serious ACTORS, and many of our most talented actors are imported from the UK. Americans that aren't watching foreign features are missing some of the best acting the world has to offer.The romance is good. The situations, the timing, the writing, the acting, the directing - it's all done with a skilled hand. It seems like it will be a shallow and empty show, but it maintains its self-respect. The interactions feel real and the attraction seems genuine. It's in their eyes. Good romance conveyed through the eyes, IRL and on film.There's weaknesses. It falls short in some areas. They could have played up the new difference in strength a little more. She is now he. She can push him around some - and he definitely has something coming. They missed some opportunities to have more fun with that. There's some plot devices that feel wedged in poorly, like the mini drama in which an ankle injury might get in the way of an important show. The weirdest thing about it is how they become attracted to eachother. Can you imagine kissing yourself? I can't.

I am a dancer and dance teacher and the only redeeming quality of this movie was that they used real and beautiful dancers. Acting skills were sacrificed to do so. That might be forgivable. The real torture lay in the script, lackluster characters, poor plot development and appalling audio issues. The music was too loud, too repetitive, and overwhelming and often times drowned out the characters' speaking. Actors were poorly miked and were difficult to hear. Had there been more dancing throughout the movie I might have felt suffering through was somehow worth it but there was very little dancing to be had. I can say this: I will never be quite as critical of all the versions of Step Up because compared to this, they're compelling cinematographic artistry.",

    "review": "I clicked on it in Netflix assuming it was a documentary - and of course that is my assumption. It's clearly listed as a drama.I kept thinking it smelt suspect... everything was too good to be true. The shots too good. I'd not heard anyone talk about it. The notion that you'd have all this film crew for something that hadn't even been confirmed yet etc. But I carried on with it assuming it was me being cynical and they were using artistic licence.It was at the 40 minute mark that I couldn't take it any longer and knew it must be fake and I hopped to IMDb and found out its true nature.I kinda admire that. This is art transgressing boundaries. Cutting through the realms of dross that Netflix almost force feeds to us. To inspire a bit of magic.All the people outraged, what else would you be doing? Watching American Celebrities Making Cakes With Clowns?I admire its brazenness - he did say it was the ship of the Unbelievable. It was there to see, in plain sight.My main complaint is I like to learn, particularly about the Roman era - and is any of it true? That's my one concern. Were any of the stories true? If we're creating fictional Roman history when there's so much that can be learnt in a great Mary Beard book that's a bit of a shame.But all too often we have so much wonder in our lives, outside our doors... but we're not interested unless it's magic or a blog is telling us we must Instagram it. This is a little reminder that there is wonder out there being made every day.",

Thiagarajan kumararaja wrote the overall story, then divided it into 4 portions each with one or two Central characters and gave these 4 portions to the 4 writers-mysskin,nalan kumaraswamy,sekar and himself. The interesting aspect of this writing process is, not only do these 4 writers have completely different styles, they didn't know what the other writer has written (although they knew the overall story as it was a singular story with interconnected different stories). Then finally, he collected all the portions and gave it final touches to make it more consistent. This is a very unique writing process.",
    "review": "No doubt Thiagarajan Kumararaja's Super Deluxe is one of the masterpiece and the cult classic film in Tamil. The moment I saw the posters of Park Chan-wook's Sympathy for Vengeance, Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill and a picture of David Lynch at the DVD Rental store in the film, I was sold, that's when I thought this is going to be full paisa vasool padam. You're getting a full package of four Film (since it has four different story) wrapped and served on a platter.In one of the interview Thiagarajan Kumararaja said he's afraid to write and he's lazy. Seriously...? When he can create wonders like Aaranya Kaandam and Super Deluxe when he's afraid and lazy, just wonder what would be the outcome if he's not lazy or afraid.Take a bow to the writers - Kumararaja, Mysskin, Nalan Kumarasamy and Neelan K. Sekhar for crafting such a phenomenal story across their views on life, relationships, love, sex and spirituality. And an extra effort made by Kumararaja to hyperlink those stories along With Idiosyncratic and Palpable characters.Samantha as Vaembu, is one heck of a performance. For the fact, she wasn't the first choice for the character, many leading actresses had turned down playing Vaembu. And now I can say, no one else could have done it better than Sam, she's irreplaceable.And our very own Makkal Selvan Vijay Sethupathi playing the transgender women Shilpa, the episodes between him and his son Rasukutty (Ashwanth Ashokkumar) Was so pure, for sure you will fall in love with that kid. Bagavathi Perumal as SI Berlin is one character where the audience will feel like thrashing him, Shilpa-Berlin and Vaembu-Berlin scenes, will definitely fill the rage in the eyes of the audience for its own reasons. Leela's (Ramya Krishnan) dialogue towards the end of the climax, will definitely hit you hard.Fahadh Faasil as Mugilan, Mysskin as Arputham, Gayathrie as Jyothi and the four kids. You will witness some awe-inspiring performance by each and everyone, proving their caliber. Even the minor characters, has done some stupendous job in acting.Once you understand Kumararaja, the same lengthy and boring scenes will now slowly transit to an interesting setting. Vinod and Nirav Shah cinematography elevates the story, the color pattern, the unconventional camera angles, along with the crisp editing by Sathyaraj Natarajan, I was spellbound.If you've already validated 'Rowdy Baby' as Yuvan Shankar Raja best in career in terms of its quality treatment and popularity, then you must Watch Super Deluxe. As they say, there's something more than that meets the eye, U1 's sound design techniques is one among that. Every minute detail that you witness in his background scoring along with Illaiyaraja songs, is something which can be considered as the added bonus to your paisa vasool ticket. And the ride ends with the compelling climax.If one can even enjoy the steady frame for more than 8 seconds and the silence within that. Then it has to be Thiagarajan Kumararaja's Film.",

Violet Evergarden starts learning about different types of emotions through this process like love and grief through listening to people's stories and seeing thier emotions of how they react when saying what they want written down in their letters. She ultimately starts getting closer to learning what her Majors last words was to her.This anime is purely story and character based it's all about character building and the emotional journey of a young girl (and it really is emotional at times and gets the feels going) there's very very minimal action so don't go expecting massive fight scenes because it isn't about that. The animation and drawings are incredible while the soundtrack is also perfect for this story and is beautifully done to get your emotions going with this story. It left me wanting to watch more and more after each episode which is always a good sign of a well done anime.\nI can honestly say it's one of my favourite anime's.Music 10/10\nVisuals 10/10\nActing 10/10\nOverall 10/10",

All that nostalgia with slow internet, music, blockbuster, tapes etc.In addition to that we have pretty nice characters. Not an extraordinary high school story but one that one wants to follow. Acting is lacking in some cases but Jahi Di'Allo Winston does a pretty good job.The adults on this show were also great to watch. Actually I think I preferred them. Sherry and Ken were both very sweet characters, really well performed and it was a joy to see the both of them together.",

    "plot": "The drama marks film actress Kim Tae-ri's small-screen debut.",
    "review": "I have been watching movies and shows for over forty years. And, yes, this show is THAT good! After watching \"Descendants of the Sun\" only a couple of years ago, I was wondering how long it would be before another grand series came about; a series that resonates with the heart and soul; a series with a crisp story and fantastic performances by the actors. And along came \"Mr. Sunshine.\"I can only think of a couple of series that are on par with \"Mr. Sunshine.\" \"Band of Brothers\" is one and \"Descendants of the Sun\" is another.What is truly sad is that much of the world is quite ignorant when it comes to Korean history, I'm sure. It's a country that always seems to be at odds with Japan, and sometimes China and Russia as well. Its turbulent history has too often been plagued by invasions or other countries attempting to gain control of the small peninsula.\"Mr. Sunshine\" tells of the time when Korea was, once again, fighting against Japanese occupation in the beginning of the 20th century. With virtually no real army to speak of and a king with little power on the throne, Korea or \"Joseon\" found itself relying on rebel guerilla tactics to try and prevent the Japanese from a complete takeover.Several characters find themselves unknowingly intertwined with each other at the outset of the series. One boy finds himself quickly orphaned and making his way to America to begin a new life. He returns to Joseon years later as a U.S. Marine Captain. Little does he know how the turn of events would pull him into the conflict between his previous homeland and Japan.The story's focal point is on three men who all happen to have feelings for the same woman, Go Ae-shin; a woman with a background as terrible and wrought with horror as the marine captain's. And yet, she is the heart and soul of the rebel forces. It is admirable and captivating to see this woman spearhead the rebellion, as well as her willingness to do whatever it takes to help her country. Tae-Ri Kim is perfectly cast, giving Ae-shin tremendous depth and complexity to her character.The cast is simply magnificent from top to bottom. Every role, no matter how large or small, is handled with immaculate precision and depth. However, there is, to my mind, one who stands out just a hair above the rest. And that is Byung-Hun Lee as Eugene Choi, the marine captain. The man has a regal distinction that very few actors in history have been able to pull off with such ease. He may appear to be emotionless in many of his scenes, but to make such an assumption would be wholly inaccurate. I've said many times: an actor/actress who can say more with their eyes than with words, is a true master at their craft. Byung-Hun Lee is such a performer. I cannot imagine anyone else playing this part with the integrity and depth that he brings to Eugene Choi.This is quite literally a \"Do not miss!\" series. With 24 episodes, each at about 75 minutes each, you are in for a wonderful treat. This is a show to savor. One might be wishing to quickly move on to the next episode, but I found myself stepping back and letting each episode soak within me instead. Like a perfect French dessert, you relish taking your time and savoring each bite. This is such a series.",

He is the type of guy you have to grow into. He may not be your traditional good-looking guy on first look but his charming face and unpretentious character just suck you in bit by bit.The chemistry between the two Kim(s) is excellent and the storyline about how their destinies are intertwined is very sweet. A destined couple helps each other heal and become a better version of him/her. Kim Ah Joong's acting skill is undeniably exquisite and she's very pretty too. They just look great together.The medical scene is well executed and the songs \"Always\" and \"Not Gonna Wait\" are my favourites too.All in all, this is an amazing romantic story about time travel that is very comforting and therapeutic, especially at this crazy lock-down period.Don't miss this hidden gem.I don't even remember how many times I've watched it.Just bring me laughter and tears every time I watch it.Give it a try; I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

I was sorely disappointed.\nThe show follows Angela Ochello (portrayed by Caroline Chikezie) as she assumes the post of Governor of Savannah State in Nigeria after the death of her predecessor.\nAlmost from the beginning, the show goes hopelessly wrong. IN an attempt to portray the main character as 'good', she is shown to be hopelessly naive, to the point that she is amazed at the existence of corruption in politics. This despite having been the vice-governor for several years. But that's the least of the show's problems. What is far worse is that the people producing it seem to be allergic to exposition or any form of conveying background information. After a whole season, I still have no idea what Savannah State is like. There are no panning shots, no discussion of its politics or economy. I don't even know what the main character's authority consists of! Half the time she seems to operate as a dictator, who can operate as she wants without having to acknowledge a local legislature or for that matter the national government. Perhaps people in Nigeria know all these things, but when you bring a show onto the international market, you need to educate your public. We're not going to watch the show with our computers open on the relevant wikipedia pages.\nAdd an almost soap-like framing of the shots and acting that borders on the ridiculous, varying between the wooden and the insanely theatrical, and you end up with a mess of a show. It;s a pity, because this could have been very interesting. But as it is, it's just total amateur hour.",

    "review": "The basis for this Singapore drama is about the conflict or the complement between western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. The male protagonist, Wu Guo En (Christopher Ming-Shun Lee), was set to become a western doctor, but a choice to save a life instead of being on time to his medical final exam forced a change to traditional medicine. Guo En went to China for six years to study traditional medicine and is now back. His former lawyer girlfriend, Ye Zhi Yi (Ann Kok), hasn't moved on from their relationship and has struggled somewhat with depression.During medical school, Guo En's main rival, who usually came in 2nd, was Guan De Wei (Ix Shen). De Wei has spent six years working at a hospital where his mother, Professor Zheng (Liyun Lin), is both a hospital administrator and a medical school professor. De Wei is proud that he has never made a surgical mistake, very strict and rigid. Dei Wei did go through tragedy during the past six years when he was unable to save his girlfriend, Moon, from death. De Wei also loves Yang Min Fei (Jesseca Liu), a doctor he mentored at the hospital, who still works there.Both Guo En's father, Wu Zhi Xiong (Shucheng Chen), and Min Fei's father, Yang Li Ming (Richard Low), practice traditional medicine, but Min Fei doesn't believe it holds much value because her father was unable to save her mother, who died while she was young. Both of the fathers know each other and often verbally spar.I appreciate the fact that most of the conflict doesn't come from simple communication problems or covering the truth, which is very, very common in Asian dramas. Don't read further if you like being surprised by watching the show.SPOILER:\nGuo En and Min Fei meet, clash, and fall in love. Zhi Yi faces depression and attacks from a disgruntled husband in a legal case.Professor Zheng sees complementary skills in combining western and traditional medicine, but her son, De Wei, increasingly resists. De Wei views Guo En as a rival he has never beaten and when he finds out that Min Fei has fallen in love with Guo En he is furious. Min Fei finds out she has inherited the same fatal disease that her mother passed away from, AML.Eventually, De Wei makes a mistake fatal to a patient while in a hurry to meet with a German researcher who might be able to help Min Fei. De Wei tries to cover up to the point that he puts other lives in danger, including one of his interns, Guo Jian Zhong (Zhen Huan Zhang) whom he lets fall down a hill where he gets hit by a vehicle. De Wei also goes to great lengths to discredit Guo En and causes him to lose confidence.Eventually, De Wei threatens Jian Zhong's gambling, idiot uncle who retaliates by running him over with a car, also injuring Guo En, who loses his memory of the past six years. Ironically De Wei dies, but could have been saved if Guo En had confidence and had been able to stay conscious long enough to do a tracheotomy.Guo En gets back together with Zhi Yi because he doesn't remember his relationship with Min Fei. Min Fei encourages this because she expects to die soon. Guo En and Zhi Yi plan their wedding, but Guo En's memory is coming back.I was disappointed that Min Fei's fate is not resolved, so it must be implied that she died after getting back together with Guo En. Then, Guo En is alone and Zhi Yi has lost him THREE times: once going to China, once when he came back and fell in love with Min Fei, and once again, after planning a wedding, when his memory returned. Anyone would be depressed from that!I prefer happy endings because I see so many unhappy endings in real life, but I still think this was better than average for an Asian drama, mostly because the majority of the conflicts were not based on \"I'm going to lie to you to protect you from heartache, but in doing so create more heartache for you\" which is so very, very common in Asian dramas. Even when Min Fei decides to break up with Guo En because she is sick, she tell him that reason straight up.",

Also, there is a soap opera element to the characters as well, and you get to seem these characters evolve as the 23 episodes play out. The cold cases also have a lot of twists and turns that will keep you guessing until they are fully resolved. The show does get somewhat darker towards the end, but the drama that unfolds will keep you interested and transfixed. What all this and much more ends up doing is making a very compelling show. It's not among the best from Asia, but it is definitely solid and worth a look. Take a look at it while it's still on Netflix!",

Not long afterward a fierce gun battle breaks out and she ends up killing all of her intended targets. The scene then shifts to seven years later where that same woman now has a husband by the name of \"Bert\" (Buji Lorenzana) and a young daughter named \"Min-Min\" (Johanna Rish Tongcua) and is quite content with her new life. Unfortunately, this changes when her former boss named \"Kaleb\" (Germaine De Leon) happens to see her and it's then disclosed that he has a score to settle with her which complicates things for all involved. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this turned out to be a pretty good action film all things considered. I especially liked the confrontation between Maria and her replacement \"Miru\" (Jennifer Lee) which I thought was well played. Admittedly, while not in the same class as any of the \"John Wick\" films, this one managed to hold its own and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",

You could tell The actress or actor was faking. But at same time. I cant picture almost anyone being able to act a few of the scenes seriously. But even then, the movie went along smoothly. There is a lot of teenage love jokes. A lot of unexpected jokes to me.If you compare it to North American films. Story 8 Acting 5-6 Comedy level 6 Background characters actors. 4 But at same time. Main actors acting. 6-7Expect final Review rating to be 6.5-7Well worth a watch for a Romantic movie thats a bit different then the Hollywood Formula. Recommended. I want to put must see. At same time some of the amateur acting made me cringe. But When i look at the heart of the movie. About the Story Moral and otherwise. I have to put Must See. Because the movie is definitely worth watching once.I Have Seen one other foreign film. 200 pound beauty which is a Korean movie not a Philipino movie and that is a 10/10 This movie is a 7-6.5. More then worth the time to have watched it. And I'm stopping now. I realize i have become long winded. lol",

The characters are easy to love because despite being robots it's easy to relate, sympathise and understand them. I don't quite understand science and sci-fi isn't really my go to. But this is definitely a new comfort show i will be watching again and again. I wish i could see more of Ido because his character growth is impeccable and crafted so well i was speechless. There are dislikable characters but i like that there aren't any hatable characters. In my opinion it's because it's easy to understand people's motivations. But the professor is 100% the most dislike-able characters.Also Rick is a lovely characters i actually adore him. I do get Denki (my hero academia) vibes from him. But he is amazing. The Lieutenant is another amazing character. While watching i did get so caught up in it that i constantly forgot Maya is a child, probably between 16 and 20 doing physical activities for the first time. But her naivety became irritating but wasn't overplayed which is great. A lot of other animes overplay the naive female role but it felt just enough. Like Maya's seemed normal like an actual teenage girl level normal.",

This film tries to achieve much yet has flaws that can be suspense breaking.Yet, I respect that this film focuses less on jumpscare and more on suspense building. The blood and guts can be toned down and the film remain powerful. Conflict feels like it's dished out to the audience instead of a more natural flow. If only the directors knew to rely less on cheaper effects for more powerful storytelling.Acting is excellent throughout. Each character giving their own spin on the film.

The teen girl main character strings along two guys , is immoral and talks back to her father,really lost interest in the movie fast . The portrayal of both groups is negative ,viewing is not recommended but maybe this is considered modern day entertainment and the Mexican producers were trying to fit in.",

    "plot": "Based on the life of Tamil Nadu-based social activist Arunachalam Muruganatham, who revolutionized the concept of menstrual hygiene in rural India by creating a low-cost sanitary-napkin machine.",
    "review": "There's a montage sometime in the first hour where the central character approaches women from different walks of life but finds it difficult to convince even one of them to try out his indigenous product. Reason? The touchy subject. Padman aspires to break this stigma associated with the subject of menstrual hygiene. From a delivery point of view, it is roaring succes.Akshay Kumar plays Lakshmi, a simple, uneducated man living with his mother, two sisters, and newly-wedded wife, Gayatri. A bit of an oddball in his thought processes, he makes it his life goal to produce low-cost sanitary napkins when he learns about the hard-up conditions that Gayatri and the women around him including his sisters, who have recently hit puberty live in, when it comes to menstruation. The religious aspect of the issue - where menstruating women are supposed to isolate themselves and live outside the house during the cycle (mostly in rural India) because they are considered impure - also bothers him, which is why Padman looks like it has been written with a complete contemplation of the issue. And, for a person, who has been exposed to high-octane, mindless Bollywood potboilers, this can come as a surprise.Padman, therefore, is a critique of our times when a technically developed country like India that aspires to be digital-ready struggles with something as crucial and necessary as menstrual sanitation. Lakshmi's attempts to educate the people around him and fight the stigma that is stuck like the plague is much more important than to invent a low-cost napkin that is both efficient and cheap. Despite being a little bit successful in the latter department, Lakshmi continuously struggles to remove the preconceptions about menstruation that people have and which they are not ready to talk about. This hesitance to converse about an issue that is tied to a woman's innate health is alarming, and Padman tries to preach about that. Of course, it's a preach, but a social film cannot do without it if it intends to send the point across. Considering that director R Balki is targeting rural India with this film, I am personally content and confident that it will tick.It is because of not just the construction of the sanitary pad but also the construction of the screenplay that this works. Padman excels in all departments, also giving intermediate knowledge about napkins if people don't know about it already. A well-written plot that reminds us of Shree Narayan Singh's 2017 hit drama on a similar social issue, 'Toilet - Ek Prem Katha', also starring Kumar, it moves ahead without hitting a bump. Of course, there are sequences that are sometimes cringe-worthy and sometimes impossible, but director Balki has evidently taken a lot of cinematic liberty, which is mandatory for a film that captures the entire essence of a social predicament such as this. The fact that Padman is based on the real-life story of the Indian inventor, Arunachalam Muruganantham, would make the viewer more confident and supportive of the structure. It's well-written, has good amounts of humour and drama, if not melodrama, and hits the right notes with its messages. With a score that supports the inspirational message, Padman must be viewed on the big screen and be marketed through word of mouth as it demands greater viewership.Akshay Kumar is phenomenal and looks like he came directly out of the aforementioned film's sets. He carries the whole film on his shoulders and never once shows an inkling of restfulness. If there is a character that I feel an actor has done complete justice to in any film in the past few months, it'd be that of Lakshmi. Equally enchanting is the supremely talented Radhika Apte's performance who seems to be made just for the role of the village wife, something that we previously saw her do in Kabali (2016), and Parched (2015) and Manjhi: The Mountain Man (2015) before that. There's not a single dull moment in Padman, thanks to the performances of the lad and the supporting cast. Sonam Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan grace the screen for some time and do a decent job, but it is the supporting actors that make the whole broth tastier. Similar to how we last saw in R S Prasanna's Shubh Mangal Savdhan (2017), another highlight of Padman is in its dialogues and general writing. Talking about a touchy subject like menstruation is already an exercise, but to make an entire feature film about it, without hitting the awkward and/or obscene point even once, is something of a marvel. Director-writer Balki and co-writer Swanand Kirkire need to be appreciated for the sensitivity that is visible throughout the film, which could have been turned into a vulgar mess had it been executed by some of the more energetic yesteryear Bollywood filmmakers. Padman excels for a lot of reasons, but tailoring it for a conservative audience is one of the major ones.Padman is refreshing because it serves several things on a single plate and yet manages to not overload it. Lakshmi's relentless attitude towards innovation makes this film much more than something about a social cause. Although India is known as the innovators' world, we hardly see such immaculate representation of the same on the silver screen. I don't care much more for the promotional angle of this film, courtesy the current ruling government in India, but as something that is important to mankind, Padman does deserve applause for its pure concoction and filmmaking brilliance. There couldn't be a better time to release this film that even has shades of chivalry (which, spare me the rolling eye, is no longer dead), feminism, and women empowerment. Lakshmi's dream must have taken him to a lot of places, but his underlying thought to not commercialize his invention and instead work for the greater good is something that makes Padman much more effective and deserving of attention.There's a good chance that if one can relate to the subject, tears are going to make a guest appearance at least once in the 140-minute running time. But, even if that does not happen, it will touch your heart through its warm characterization, entrepreneurship, and the sheer ability to pump your beat up. Padman is perhaps R Balki's best film so far, something that I would even go as far as to list in Kumar's filmography as well. TN.",

Debutante Karthik is astonishingly poor in her performance, not moving even her lips while talking. Chakalakkal is a familiar face and also manages to pull his part decently. So does Joju George and other supporting actors. With useless songs thrown around and an attempt to highlight the fallacies of the medical industry, Melle chugs as a feeble story. It goes on for about 2 hours with a predictable ending that does not make you feel anything. Do you feel for this woman and her lover? No. Do you understand what director Ulahannan had wanted to convey? No. Does this film come recommended? No. TN.",

    "review": "I am so amazed by Joan Didion's life, her talents, her brilliance, her strength, and her tragic losses. In this documentary, you see Joan as she is now - a frail and elderly woman with multiple sclerosis, being interviewed by her nephew, Griffin Dunne. Joan is brilliant and, even though she is in her 80s, you see a spark in her eyes. By the way, she was also married to John Gregory Dunne, a very famous writer as well (whose brother you may know - Dominick Dunne), and you feel like you know John by the end of this documentary. During this documentary, she talks about a point in her marriage when she and John were going to get a divorce, but moved instead, and eventually stayed together and grew even closer. This amazed me because I assume (since I am not married) and hear that marriages go through peaks and valleys. To see this whole documentary and then wonder what would have happened if they had divorced when they were having problems instead of staying together as they did, this story would not be the same at all. Even after having their problems, it seems (by all accounts) that these two had a great love.This is not only a documentary, but a lesson for life in a way. I only wish I can be as strong as Joan is when and if I reach her age. She is very open and honest about everything, and you see a side of her that makes you feel like you are watching her without her knowledge -- thoroughly fascinating.Toward the end of this documentary, there are some very sad and shocking things that happen, but what is amazing is the way that Joan (unprepared as we all are for the death of our loved ones) proceeds with her life, and you will find the way she deals with these tragedies astonishingly brave. I knew Joan was and is a wonderful and a one-of-a-kind writer, but I didn't know what an amazing person she is as well.This documentary is a must-see, even if you have just for the first time learned about Joan Didion. It is an especially beautiful experience for lovers of Joan's writing, as well as lovers of literature and life.",

I became a huge fan of him after watching \"The Great Indian Kitchen\" and I was curious about this movie only because of him. The story is about a guy, the only bread owner of the family is going through financial crisis. He gets offered a job of a tour guide to an American lady and the story goes on.Tovino Thomas is the protagonist here. He performed really well. Despite being the protagonists, Joju George and Siddharth Shiva's performances were amazing. India Jarvis who plays the role of the American lady, was meh! The movie tells about human feelings. It says that the human relationships are also important. Money will not give you the ultimate happiness. Direction and cinematography are good. The comedy timing is perfect. All the songs are beautiful. The first half is really entertaining. But the second half is kind of bollywoodish. India is all about different cultures and different languages. These differences are perfectly shown in this movie. Some breathtaking views of Tamilnadu, Karnataka, Gujrat are taken.I know, many of us are completely locked between the four walls. We didn't even go for a trip from a long time. It's a tough time for us. I think, this film can slightly pacify our anxieties. According to me, \"Kilometers and Kilometers\" is indeed a feel good and light hearted film you can watch with your family.P. S: It's not a masterpiece like \"The Great Indian Kitchen\". Do not raise your expectations. Otherwise, you'll be disappointed.",

It's quite different from her previous movies, which are all serious and history related, except of course Refrain, which was her debut movie. So, my first impression about this movie was spot-on. I watched the first fifteen minutes and I was bored already. The comedy is kinda trashy, I have to say. Why all the English learners have to be from various ethnicity? What a coincidence! And they're not funny at all! That's why I stopped watching it and started it again the next few weeks.Surprisingly, the next scene was much better. It made me laugh although certain jokes degraded women. I think both Chelsea and Hamish did a great job. Hamish totally gave his all to act as a low class dude. As a sad scene, Chelsea Islan did quite so good it made me teary. Well, I did cry. This was what I didn't expect from this movie. Great job both of you. But, the story itself actually didn't really strong. I mean, the details are not so convincing, especially the family background of Amira and ones of Miller Khan's role. The change of personality of Miller Khan's somehow irrelevant to me. Why brought up family if you couldn't make a good description about them?",

    "review": "It's the rare film that gets its value upon reflection rather than during watching. It's not boring as such, but with its extremely long runtime it does generally feel slow paced and often runs the risk of being quite dull. Luckily though, the pure sense of mystery that surrounds the three core players (our protagonist included) and the film's world as a whole keeps things intriguing throughout. As the narrative progresses, however, and the core mystery of the piece arrives, things get a lot more intriguing and this intrigue lasts long after the haunting finale. That's where the film really gets its merit. None of the enigmas are definitively answered, and this leads to an extremely subtle - yet wholly rewarding - experience that allows you to draw your own conclusions of what it was actually about. The picture could be about several different things, and it all depends on the individual spectator response. This, as well as the complete lack of on-the-nose exposition, is very refreshing in today's age of cinema where nothing is left to the imagination anymore. We are not told, or even explicitly shown, anything integral to answer the core mystery and this allows you to reflect on all of the intricacies of several different scenes in order to draw your own conclusions. It really is a one of a kind experience that will leave you scrutinising for days, discovering a new narrative possibility upon every thought. Its slow pace and the sense that it's not really going anywhere might make it seem hard to get through initially, but once it's over it becomes a rich, rewarding experience. 8/10",

There is archive footage and new footage/interviews, that depict the impact he had, not just with and for the Raptors but with the NBA.As far as recent displays of affection by LeBron James, though that was more directed at the really incredible crowd that cheered the Toronto Raptors even after they got eliminated by the Cavaliers. With an hour running time, this is short enough but also long enough to give an inside look that should be satisfying. Again, at least an interest into Basketball should be there, otherwise I don't think makes much sense watching this",

    "review": "These types of documentaries always interest me, regardless if they were actually any good or needed to be made. Many people will dislike a movie like this simply because they will think it is just a way to make more money for a whole of people that already have tonnes of money. Or the problems they face aren't really problems, and watching someone whinge about how hard their life is when they have a mansion and millions of followers is excruciating. But I find it quite captivating. In many ways I think these movies capture quite a clear extract of modern pop culture and share it with the world. I find it educating to see how someone like Lady Gaga lives her life, what her day to day looks like, what annoys her or what gets her excited, or what someone of this fame's values are. Most of the time I come away from a movie like this, thankful I'm not famous, or a pop star, thankful that I have my own quiet place with a handful of people that care about me, and I was again in this viewpoint after watching Gaga.She shares an insight on what it is like to work for producers and some of the power plays going on behind the scenes that just seem so twisted and power hungry as she shares about the dynamics at play when men with lots of money can ask for whatever they want. It's no wonder that the #Metoo movement was exposing many people like this, and long may it continue.Alongside this Gaga also displays many of her inner traumas as she is processing her break up with her fiance and trying to return to preforming while coming back from a hip injury. You can quite clearly see the mental weight of keeping up with trends, of trying to find yourself, of being secure, or doing what you feel you were made to do. All things that Gaga is trying to put her own spin on. She decides that this is because she's become a woman and not a girl anymore, that its something to do with age. But I think this clearly shows that fame can just prolong maturity, that she lost her sense of herself in her fame of 21, 22. She didn't know what she wanted and just went with what she was told. Compared to her now deciding what she wants. This is something I feel like, I'm able to do sooooo much easier, at a much younger age, and that becoming famous in your early 20s at a time of such change, insecurity and identity development is actually such a burden, something that can take years to unravel.So this doco, is a bit strange, but as I've said uncovers quite a hidden world and really shows that fame and fortune are really just a huge disappointment and to put your hope in them is a terrible idea. Great to watch the doco from this point of view, any other view and its just ok.",

This movie gave a whole new meaning to the word god awful because it was so bad. This movie had all the right components for a great movie but they were in all the wrong places and in a movie with no plot whatsoever. If you are a parent wanting to give your child a punishment, SPF-18 will do justice. In fact, if you are any human being whatsoever wanting to punish yourself, a family member, a friend, or even your fish go ahead and put this movie on. My first question of many is what drugs the screenwriter, director and producer were on when they a) thought of this movie and b) decided to actually go through with it. My second question is how did this movie even get any funding? My final question is with the funding from this movie how much of it went to therapy for the actors and viewers for their ptsd of having to be in or see this movie? I've been in elementary school plays that had better acting than this one. \nWhile writing this review it got deleted up until this point and I've had to recall everything I wrote before. At first, I was thinking, \"Wow I don't know if I can do this\". But then, I remembered that I got through watching all of Spf-18 so surely I could rewrite this review. So here you have it. You're welcome for this review that I've taken so much time for which clearly the producers of Spf-18 didn't care to do.",

For me, there are problems.There are times where I almost felt that I was watching four different stories. Story one is about a girl and her twin sister, who is a demon or evil. Story two is about a cop who is working a murder case. Story three is about a group of boys who were sent to juvie for various reasons and came out on a mission. And, story four is about a pastor who investigates cults.It isn't unusual to have several storylines that are interlaced and this one is but it has been done in an odd way. There are characters who are introduced but we see very little of them throughout the film. It is also a bit convoluted when it came to giving a clear understanding about all that was going on but I will be fair in saying that I was watching the film with subtitles and some things may have been lost in translation.This is marketed as a horror film but it felt like a thriller to me. I watch a lot of horror though and I may be somewhat desensitized. Nothing about it every really rose to a level of horror. Creepy. Maybe. Not horror though.It isn't a terrible movie.

Where the heroine was stoic and strong in the first two, here she's just a blubbering mess of emotions, crying when her toenails get stubbed, or crying when a cat falls out of a tree. I'm being facetious, but my goodness, if you're a detective, DEAL with tragedies head on, not whimper like a soulless moron who'd never seen blood before.

Probably more but these were the first things came to my thoughts on my very first impression of the animation. TThe animation was cute although seems a bit low budget/ quality compared to other LEGO animations like the ninjago especially. Sounds scores and tracks were average for me. Storyline was meh, nothing particularly new or bad but just okay. Tbh it felt like a continuation of something since it started with little to no explanation on certain characters and the world building itself seems to be lacking a valid introduction. I could be wrong but it definitely felt like a sequel or prequel of other titles.Characters design and arc were okay as well and not a fan of the main characters. For me side characters were much more interesting. Voice casts were okay. The world building aspect was underwhelming, most of the characters were taken more into comedic approach rather than something relatable to the viewers - hence no connection to the audience. Weak villains and lack of actions.Overall its an okay animation with generic plot and average quality wise at all parts. Recommended although seems to be a one-time watch only animation.

The cast, led by Isaac Jay's Noah and Bevin Bru's Camille, gives us a series of spirited performances that truly convey the increasing terror of the group as they are terrorized by a supernatural entity.

Good TV told from the Arabic lenses, and deals with sensitive topics such as loss, gender, class, and cultural values. The show provides unabashed realism of the vast gray areas between a secular Islam and fanatic fundamentalism, writ large. What I like is to see a series that goes beyond typical West VS East, cosmopolitan VS terrorist values, good guys VS bad guys plots associated with today's, pretty much universal, \"Other\": ISIS. Also, the show tackles gender and terrorism in a very 2018 way, meaning that the women here are self-aware and possess a sense of personal power and purpose. Finally, while the dialogue is good, the acting and filmography are so expressive, the vignettes are interrelated, yet tightly constructed, and the suspense is so palpable that the linguistic barrier is quite negligible. Very little cognitive dissonance. In comparison, I don't think a Bollywood series could do this or has done this. Definitely has a Netflix or Amazon series production feel. Overall, very good TV, glad I found it!",

Aneesh Menon is the head of a video advertising agency who thinks that the woman in this photo is the woman who has been chatting with and who he now is in love with. I like the idea of how perversion is the main character here (thanks also to Raveendran's cringeworthy cameo), but the poorly stitched narrative of random sequences that do not add up anything to the film is what will make you doze off in the first 10 minutes itself. The story, or whatever you can call it here, starts only after 30 minutes, before which Menon and his co-stars are seen fooling around. There is hardly any comedy in the proceedings, which affects the entertainment quotient, further affected by the ridiculous acting by Anita Lukmance, Vineeth Mohan (who did a great performance in John Varghese's 2015 horror comedy Adi Kapyare Kootamani), and others. Despite having a moral at the end, Cappuccino suffers from rookie filmmaking and hence cannot be recommended.

    "review": "However good might be director Noushad's intentions, his directorial venture Cappuccino can be only seen as an amateur and haphazard attempt at highlighting a social issue. That how circulation of a photo of an aspiring model wreaks havoc in the lives of at least four people is the central theme of Noushad's comedy drama. Aneesh Menon is the head of a video advertising agency who thinks that the woman in this photo is the woman who has been chatting with and who he now is in love with.

Campos called Pattinson a \"mad genius who can do anything.\"",

Pollock gives an excellent narrative full of opinions and insults for each character. The story is well written, even with the cross between storylines witch is always difficult to do.

That movie and Zabawa Zabawa (Party Party) are similarly powerful but differ in perspective. The Mighty Angel deals mostly men whose lives have cratered. They turn to each other for help without improving their lives it's gritty and hard to watch.By contrast, Zabawa Zabawa starts out squeaky-clean by comparison. We are introduced to three women, a student, an award-winning doctor and a successful lawyer. It seems as if all is well in their lives until we discover that each one has a dirty secret, a love of John Barleycorn, among other illicit loves in their lives. Zabawa Zabawa becomes difficult to watch as we see the secret creep out in the open and their lives result in loss of jobs, endangerment of lives of others and rape. As with Angel, there are no happy endings.This is an uncomfortable watch but a worthwhile one.",

However then it decided to try to shoehorn in a love story, a few musical numbers, as well as predictable dramatic plot line and ended up a muddled mess.Richard Dreyfuss as others have mentioned, did very well as the comedian who gave up his career for his family... I thought the roles might be reversed as Chevy had more experience doing live comedy but instead he tried to rehash a version of his uptight Clark Griswold persona playing his agent and Andie McDowell was wasted as the love interest.So bottom line, if you're looking for the next Kominsky Method or Grace and Frankie... you are probably better off moving on to the next on your queue.",

You don't really connect with the characters either since you don't spend much time with any of them and there's no real character development.BUT -- it really brought me back to a time when I and people my age really cared about music, and being in a band, and we built this entire activity up to become something solid and tangible for us to hang the other parts of life, and as an excuse to develop our personalities. I was never in a band myself but it still brought me back. The movie was made in 2019 but really it's a movie about the mid-to-late 2000s. It's not really a teen movie. It's for people who were teens fifteen years ago.I felt a general, low-key buzz of pleasure throughout this movie. The plot and dialogue are mostly inoffensive, and the people are pretty, and the tunes are perfect in that quintessential 2000s indie rock way -- catchy and good but not really very memorable when divorced from the personal context of your life.I understand that Dazed and Confused is a better made movie, but what can I say?

Mr Jones has done so much for Black people and just people everywhere by simply doing what he does best! He is a workhorse who doesn't stop until his tasks are done, and he has taken on so many tasks that most of us would deem impossible.

But, because the plot is so thin and the pacing is relatively slow... the main character doesn't really interact with anyone outside of her roommate in more than 3-4 scenes, meaning no real development takes place.The net result is a movie that just kind of exists for the sake of it. \"The New Romantic\" wasn't bad, but I honestly don't think anyone would notice if it didn't exist.",

Crimson Tide and The Hunt for Red October may be the only couple of good ones off the top of my head in the last 30 years.This French language film popped up on Netflix, and I'm glad I watched it. The film follows a sub crew as they confront a realistic crisis of Russian aggression and terrorism. The main character, Chanteraide (Fran\u00e7ois Civil) is a sub listener, and there are tense moments as he must figure out if the sound he hears is a far off whale, or a torpedo coming for the kill. The cast is filled out with a host of French actors, many of who I recognized from other films.The film is more a suspense than an action film, more Red October, and less Crimson Tide in that sense, but there are some very good action scenes. The plot is not unique, but very well executed, and sets up some very well done moral dilemmas, again similar to Crimson Tide.These moral dilemmas end up being the best part of the film but unfortunately could have been an even larger part of the film, a rare missed opportunity in the film.Although it fails to achieve in several areas, it still sets itself apart from the average drone of current action films. Although I am tempteted to give it an 8, 7/10 is the review. Don't deep six this one!",

Every character has their own thing going on, for example one guy gets beaten up a lot, one dude likes to have sex all the time, one girl likes to eat food and vomit it out, and another character is \"normal.\"I do like this film and it has some graphic sex in here.Another good Japanese movie that most Westerners will probably not like, but if you are into Japanese anime, manga, ultra dark and disturbing Japanese stuff, this is a movie for you.8/10",

The never ending blood feud of the left and right wing parties in the Kannur district which has its roots in the ancient warrior culture of Chekavar has never been shown in a film with such honesty. Even with all this, the film falters with its narrative by not keeping the viewers engaged. The acting is mostly very good but it is the two lead actors who lack consistency throughout the film. For a directorial debut of an editor, the editing could have been much tighter with almost an hour longer than needed in there. The inclusion of the balcony scene was unexpected and they pulled it off perfectly which is quite amazing considering the tone of the film.",

    "review": "It's quite often when an animated film comes out and they try to imitate or to simulate the same narrative aspects or the same characterisation or even the same animated standards of Disney. Sometimes it's so good it stands out, but other times the story mechanics are very familiar with Disney that it can make the film very far from being a success. Over the Moon is a charming Chinese inspired animation that's both victim to that but also different to that and thankfully sets the bar quite high in animated filmmaking. The story is very familiar a teenage girl is trying to get over the death of her mother and to do that she must embark on a journey of enlightenment to move on. We've seen it all before, but the one thing that's different is the colours whether it's the weird and wonderful creatures walking around or the stunning picturesque views of China's landscape. It will often remind you of Spirited Away or Inside Out or other brilliantly successful animations. Granted Over the Moon may not be new when it comes to the storytelling or the pain we all experience when feeling grief but the colours alone make it a wild success and lest we forget the glorious tunes to boot which will make you cry, make you dance and make you smile. It's likely that Netflix will go to the Oscars with this but whether they'll get the prize is a different story. But it flies high past other films of 2020 and could actually be the best animated film of the year...maybe. 4/5.",

This little known story that surely deserves to be told, is based on the real story of the Polish Government moving itself and their military to Britain after Poland was invaded by the Germans in the west and the Russians in the east. But Does MISSION OF HONOR do this story justice? With tarty WAFs, bullying snobbish RAF pilots, and dispicable RAF officers, the inspirational core of the story seems to get lost in a series of unfortunate events, which should be that these highly skilled pilots decimated the Luftwaffe, outshone the British pilots, flew day and night in all weather daringly downing double the number of the planes that the British downed, and turned the tide of the war by preventing Hitler from invading Britain, and therefore making it possible for the Americans to have bases there. Perhaps this story has not been told in war movies because the West is ashamed of the ending. While the allies won the war, Poland became a satellite of the Soviet Union, and the Polish Military were not allowed to be a part of the Victory Parade because it would have offended Stalin. This movie is unsurprisingly anti-British in its bias, but does not allude to how the Polish pilots were appreciated by the common people of Britain as their exploits were heralded on the radio and Pathe News.",

I for one did only know that much. It becomes pretty clear what direction this will go ... and while it is mostly psychological horror there is some vivid physical horror and violence too. And there is an ending you may predict or see coming. Once you start something, it's not just as easy as ... switching something off. Interesting premise, nicely played out",

    "review": "Saw Mary Winstead in Brain Dead, which is the only reason I watched this film. She absolutely killed it in that role, so there was a lot of good will and openness for me going in. 6/10 is generous, but for some reason I still like her.For starters, she was playing a stand-up comic and I didn't think she was all that funny, and to go out of your way to bring up gross images that are supposedly funny regarding women may be part of the point of the film, but I didn't like it at all. Maybe women try to be as gross as men with comedy, I don't know 'cause I don't go to comedy clubs, the other female comediennes seemed to be going for that effect as well.And, once again, maybe this was deliberate, but to have her pacing around topless in her apartment rehearsing for her act was a real turn off. I would guess that 10% of the population at large looks good naked or nearly naked (at least for me), and it takes away somewhat from my seeing her as attractive, as in an attractive leading lady. Guys are guys (unfortunately, I wish I wasn't so affected by the visual), but a film is a visual medium, I didn't appreciate having that bit of mystic removed.That it was revealed this film was a vehicle for victims of abuse towards the end explained alot. But overall, I didn't feel that much for this character, I didn't feel like I got to know her, just saw mostly her acting out and having a very defensive approach to life- overall something women may relate to more, but it sure wasn't entertaining.",

I am sure that the draft for \"Oversize Cops\" might have worked out well enough in concept idea and on paper, but the transition to the screen at the hands of directors Phuwanit Pholdee and Chanon Yingyong just left much to be wanted.First and foremost, more comedy and laughs would have been a nice thing to have had in the movie. For a comedy then \"Oversize Cops\" was frightfully devoid of funny situations and actually failed to make me laugh, much less smile. No, \"Oversize Cops\" was a swing and a miss. Perhaps it was because the comedy - or lack thereof - in the movie was something that didn't appeal to me at all.The acting in the movie was adequate enough, taking into consideration the massive restrictions a lack of proper storyline and contents to the script imposed on the actors and actresses in the movie.If you enjoy Thai comedies, then there are far, far better choices readily available out there in a great abundance. I wouldn't personally recommend anyone to sit down to watch \"Oversize Cops\". It just was too devoid of anything funny.My rating of \"Oversize Cops\" is a generous three out of ten stars.",

The ground is small than the normal ones. Think of 7s as a bridge between Futsal and Football. 2) Malappuram is a small town in the state of Kerala, India. Football is a craze there. Think the place of as a mini Brazil/Spain/German state of football fans). Majeed is an unmarried young man, who is managing a Football team. He only source of income is from winning games. Due to his 'unemployment' status, getting a girl becomes difficult. (A background: Arrange marriage is still the norm in major parts of India. A steady income for the groom to be is a must for families) Majeed is dedicated to football and to his club. To strengthen his squad, he brings in players from Nigeria (A background: A lot of Africans play in these 7s league in Kerala). The stars seem to shine on him as he starts to win thanks to his newly joined players, especially Samuel. Samuel steals the heart of the football fanatics and becomes the top scorer for his team. Since most of the people from Malappuram are not quite sure of the geographical layout of Africa, they start to call Samuel as Sudani. While Samuel makes an effort to correct them by stating that he is from Nigeria, people started to address him as Sudani from Nigeria (It's similar to calling someone a German from England or an Asian from America). Samuel decides to stick to what people call him. An accident to Samuel/Sudani makes him unfit. Compounding the problem, it seems the time to recover is long and as Samuel's sponsor, the responsibility falls on Majeed's shoulder. With no money to entrust Samuel/Sudani in the hospital, Majeed has to make a decision. This movie is not an action packed thriller or a suspense drama flick. It's an evenly paced simple movie. I have to stress this for the fact that people might watch this movie with the wrong set of expectations and that will spoil the mood. For those who have watched Thondimuthalam Drikshakashiryum (another wonderful movie), this one is of the same genre. The setting, selection of actors (most of whom I'm watching for the first time), the music, direction, acting is brilliant. Subish, the actor who plays Majeeed, seem to pick all the right roles. He started playing comedy roles and have picked up roles that fit within, what he thinks, is his range of suitable roles. Thanks to him, we are able to see the emotion behind an ordinary 'unemployed' football manager. While the movie is connected to Football, the actual action of the movie is outside of the field. Majeed's struggle. Sudani's struggle post injury, his background story and more. Humor is a constant companion. Most of the characters seem to have some humor induced in them and it's wonderfully executed. Majeed, in one scene, compares himself to his struggles and to that of Zidane. In one way, both have the same problems, the primary difference being money and attention each get. Who stole the show? While Subish aka Majeed does a brilliant job, for me, it was Majeed's mother. What a wonderful actress. She portrays the role of a loving mom, who burns inside for his son is executed in an exquisite way. My sincere apologies for getting your hopes high if you haven't watched the movie. I just couldn't control showering praise on her. Now, don't watch expecting an Al Pacino style acting. Nah! This is a perfect reflection of how a muslim woman, who, in a patriarchal world, responds. She gets you emotionally hooked. Her neighbor friend is equally wonderful. Loved her way of looking at the ** (hidden due to spoiler) when they come and how she taunts them. The cameo by the actor who portrays yesteryear martial artist is also a treat. Even though he comes and goes in a blink of an eye, to entertain such a character is what makes the movie a treat of watch. All the side characters are so part of the movie and it makes the movie whole. I want to refrain form calling this movie amazing, fantastic and such superlatives, because the movie is soul-felt (if there is such a word).

Alone, I must add.This documentary is creepy on the motel level, and was actually interesting on the Gay Talese portion, but then even that gets too twisted for me.I felt the muscles in my mouth tightening and my teeth clinching until my teeth and cheeks hurt. Enough already.Talese claims the motel owner and voyeur is a nice normal guy. Nope. He is not. He is a sleazy guy in sunglasses that would give me the creeps and literally make my skin crawl if I ran into him anywhere - cause he did that while on my TV. Oh. The voyeur believes God has a hand in everything. There are no words ............. because my teeth are clinched.Foos - the man who wanted the attention so very desperately is a total character - and not in a good sense. One to be taken in incredibly small doses. I took me 4 hours to watch this documentary due to Foos's bravado and \"look at me!! Look at me!!\" mentality. He was exhausting and exasperating through out the entire process covering decades. Anita, his wife, needs to be put up for sainthood.On the other hand, I fast forwarded to Talese parts on - and there were some interesting points.This documentary is a massive disappointment.

This dramatized and often inaccurate version of historical events surrounding the Russian Revolution drives an important point home: violent revolutions are extremely destructive and risky. They unleash the darkest drives within people and allow sociopaths to take the reigns. The production (including the script, dialogue, acting, effects, sets, titles with historical detail on characters) is excellent. I was pulled in by the drama and was not let down. As a student of history who studied the Russian Revolution in grad school, I was aware of important distortions, but dramatic films are statements, not histories. This statement is well made. I am intrigued by the potential impact in Russian society today, where a dictator is willing to lie and kill to maintain power. Is this a statement about Russia today? Is it a statement to the world as the nativist, repressive and violent tendencies of governments are on the rise? Is it about the Russian past, an effort to remind the Russian people about what went down and what might happen again? Perhaps it is all these things. No matter it is a well done series, well worth watching.",

    "review": "Having raked in over $600m at the box office, The Wandering Earth is yet another massive blockbuster from China. However, like so many enormous Chinese blockbusters in recent years, it's all style and no substance, with excessive emphasis on special effects and incoherent fantasy that really impedes any attempts to craft a more elegant or majestic space opera.And that's where I want to start, because from the beginning of this movie, you'll likely be reminded of a number of other films that go about telling sci-fi stories in a rather different way. The Wandering Earth is based on a novel of its own, so it's not in any way a Chinese remake, but the premise and key ideas explored in the film, particularly in the opening act, are hugely reminiscent of both Christopher Nolan's Interstellar and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.Now, both Interstellar and 2001 are absolute masterpieces of modern sci-fi, because they tell a fantasy story with a stunning sense of grandeur and majesty that can't be achieved in any other genre. In that, while both movies have a plot and characters of their own, it's almost as if space itself is their main component, with astonishing visual effects playing into an eye-opening and almost spiritual depiction of the final frontier.The Wandering Earth, on the other hand, takes a far more simplistic and unfortunately dull approach to telling a sci-fi story. It does have the special effects to dazzle (although I talk more about that in a moment), but it feels so much more like a formulaic space adventure movie, rather than the majestic space opera that it's so desperately trying to be.Its opening sequence depicts the ever-intensifying threat of celestial destruction, and throughout, the film relates personal difficulties and tragedies in tandem with the danger of space travel and colonisation. And yet, while all of those ingredients make the film ripe for the sort of emotionally hard-hitting and elegant watch that is a great space opera, it's all overwhelmed by its more basic blockbuster tendencies.In that, the film's quartet of young leads takes a little of the grandeur out of the story, bringing it closer to something reminiscent of the YA genre, while the special effects are often totally over the top, with an excessively brash and chaotic depiction of the dangers and threats present in space, something that really isn't necessary, as proved by better films such as Interstellar and Gravity.On top of that, its near future setting, although only in the late 2050s, feels light years away from the present we know today. Unlike Interstellar, whose near future is almost identical to the present day, The Wandering Earth is full of fantasy and sci-fi gibberish about the Earth of the future that's both fairly incomprehensible and difficult to relate to, further taking away from your ability to emotionally engross yourself in the story and feel the real power of what this story has to offer.And I say that because, despite not thinking much of the movie, there are moments where the film really tries hard to be something more majestic and elegant than just another space adventure. Its fantasy and excessive special effects often make it feel more like Jupiter Ascending than Interstellar, but there are a few moments of emotional intrigue and pathos that do indicate its intentions, and briefly provide an engrossing and impressive respite from an otherwise both chaotic and formulaic movie.Overall, then, I wasn't particularly taken by The Wandering Earth. Its ambition is clear from the start, and with a premise that's reminiscent of real greats of modern sci-fi, it should have been an elegant, moving and majestic watch. However, with a generic plot that's far heavier on brash special effects, fantasy mumbo jumbo and chaotic action, it really misses the mark when delivering a sci-fi that's a little more special to the normal fare.",

I also have wondered about the US jury system as well. Does it make sense to use 12 ordinary people to decide such complex issues?

A simple, uncomplicated film.Paraguayan humor is funny, but not for everyone, in part because it takes into account local folklore. As a Brazilian, I understood most of the references, but I can see people in this globalized world not understanding some of the themes.The plot is simple: minimal beef between cartels; SENAD wants to arrest the powerful boss. However, they can't get enough evidence for a case, so they keep a close eye on the cartel to find anything that works. Ex-Machina helps SENAD at one point.The climax is, of course, the final apprehension. A bit forced, for my taste, but true to reality to a certain extent.A simplistic film with no ambitions. Watch it calmly with a little popcorn if you want to see something different by independent producers.",

Cheap and easy.This film is the opposite, it's deceptive and not in a \"ahhh wasn't expecting that\" sort of way. More a feeling of being completely ripped off and dissatisfied kinda way.\n We honestly really enjoyed a good majority of this film, so many things that look like they're building up to a really good twist at the end. Mysterious characters, red herrings, things that could be linked together in a really cool way.How naive and utterly wrong we were.There is no point to this film. Literally, why was this film made?\nIt's like they employed a really good writer for the first half of the film who put together a brilliant structure and then some idiot decided to take over and realised he/she was in over their head. \nBy the last shot I was honestly screaming \"DO NOT ROLL CREDITS\" and my sister had to restrain me when the goddam screen went black.This review may seem extra, but I have never been so angry, frustrated and disappointed by a potentially great film.I urge you not to waste your time.

And it gets very, very tense, sometimes so awkward it becomes almost unbearable to watch. I can see why so many people have trouble with this!The couple are faced with an age-old problem that most likely affects a majority of couples, and one which they are doubtless are too embarrassed to talk about. Because, really, how do you talk about something like this and still try to convince your partner that, while they might not do it for you sexually, you still very much love them?It's an interesting premise approached in a very adult way, using humour to deflect the more crushing moments.

    "review": "Hugo Blick is arguably the most ambitious writer of television drama in Britain today, and he certainly restates his case with 'Black Earth Rising', his latest work, which is by turns brilliant, intelligent and maddening. The series touches upon an immensely difficult subject - the Rwandan genocide - and amazingly manages to give mass murder a delicate, nuanced treatment without hiding from the horror. The acting and direction are also first rate. And yet, I found the central character deeply unappealing (though impressively portrayed by Michaela Coel), a person who demands the right to set the terms of debate with an inner sense of absolute moral certainty. Blick's script allows for the fact that she might be a difficult person to be around; but not that she might be wrong. And if part of Blick's skill is to distill huge issues into personal dramas, there are perhaps unintended side effects, most obviously that the fate of a country seems to be in the hands of a handful of people, all of whom know each other extremely closely, but this goes uncommented upon. In some ways, these two issues coincide - that the good guys have the right to represent their nation is presented almost as a given. Yet while I can nitpick, it's a story that will remain in my mind long after countless police procedurals have been forgotten. It's worth your time.",

Certain sequences, especially one near the middle of the film are Oscar worthy. Content of the film is invaluable and well communicated. This is a BBC Storyville documentary film and is of higher quality than what you typically see on Netflix, from younger inexperienced filmmakers. BBC Storyville released another good documentary last year that is also worth seeing: The Work (2017). Different writers/directors, yet still good.The pacing in this is better than your average Netflix documentary, thanks not just to better editing, directing and writing, but the presentation being in documentary film format, and not the stretched-out documentary series format we see so much of now. Where documentaries which should be 2 hours are stretched out over 6 to 10 and puffed out with much repetition (an awful trend to increase viewing time for their shareholders at the expense of quality and people's time). Wild Wild Country being a prime example of such abuse of the viewer's time, which should have been two episodes and not six. Or preferably documentary film format, like this hidden gem-where filmmakers are forced to cut the unnecessary. If you can find it, watch it. A theatrical release would have been handy. No sign of it on DVD or streaming at this point-Dec 2018. Update: someone uploaded it to YouTube ;-)",

    "review": "Far too reverential a treatment for one of the most monstrous people in American public life, a rabid ideologue grown wealthy and famous through the exploitation of the real and imagined suffering of others. The film is well made in every department but asks none of the difficult questions you'd want to see asked, never once scratching the surface, accepting the narrative and worldview presented by Allred as the only one possible, and so ends up being little more than a journalistic puff piece and largely pointless. The only questioning voices came from three-second long clips of Allred's cartoon depictions in The Simpsons and South Park.In 2018, the presentation of oneself as a victim is the surest path to power, money, and fawning adoration, and Allred has this down herself impeccably. But both on an individual and societal level, this is a terrible way to live, and the identity politics she is ticking the boxes of at every opportunity throughout this documentary is eating away at both our culture and our future like a cancer.There is a great documentary waiting to be made addressing the hysteria and insanity western society is presently consumed by, and the role played by Allred and her ilk in both initiating and exacerbating that hysteria, but this sadly is not it.",

    "review": "Animation - The show's animation is extremely fluid. It helps that it comes from the same animation studio that animated Rise of the TMNT, which also has beautiful animation. It also has a nice color palette that's easy on the eyes, and good geometric character designs.Writing - The show has fairly good writing. The story is engaging and unique, and the dialogue is sharp. There's also a lot of video game references to stuff like Pokemon, Sonic, and Castlevania for all of us video game nerds out there.Characters - The show's characters are also well-written, and get a lot of development. Five and Miko genuinely seem like real people that you would meet and have a lot of traits to round them out, as well as a good dynamic with each other. Bitt is adorable, and Mitch is the guy you love to hate. The only problem is that Zahra and Haneesh don't get enough screen time or development, but hopefully they will in future episodes.Music - The show's music really stands out. It's 8-bit and inspired by retro video games, obviously. The opening theme and credits songs are both really catchy.Enjoyment - The only problem I have is that it drags sometimes due to being 22 minutes and not 11 minutes, but overall it's a fun show with a compelling story, great action scenes, smooth animation, likable characters, everything you need to make a great Nicktoon. It's a crying shame that Nickelodeon screwed it over and dumped it on Netflix. Everyone complains that Nickelodeon doesn't come up with original ideas anymore when this show and the new show It's Pony exist. Support both of those shows if you want more original ideas from Nickelodeon.",

Without a detailed backstory as to why there is almost a millennium-old ethnic friction among over 300 Nigerian tribes in one country, this movie did an excellent job of portraying the essence of being Nigerian, being a person (male or female) and showing how the country can evolve to live in unity despite cultural differences. It is also an ode to the bond of family, roots of any culture and using the best of both international exposure with being Nigerian to create different facets of what a success story for anyone can be. It had the pleasantly surprising comedy, a fresh take on what predecessors can do for their successors and so many sublime messages touching on love, family, culture, politics, leadership, feminine strength (no nauseating feminism I promise) that can be easy to miss.Well done Genevieve Nnaji: a movie for all to see.

Netflix must get thousands with the same bloody main plot, and reject them. Warner Bros, Sony probably do too and keep maybe 2 out of a hundred. Netflix, on the other hand, get (say) a hundred of these assassin scripts and keep 50, and seemingly work through them making movies to fill a need. They love them. They tolerate much more, lame and average scripts, than you would expect a movie studio to... but then they are essentially a TV station, and have more time to fill.This film is your typical double-hard assassin movie. Well made - I like the lead and supporting cast - plus it looks good, is watchable, but ultimately is generic and predictably unoriginal. The plot will have no surprises, and will be the least interesting aspect, but it won't offend you too much either. Maybe as a slightly older person, I have seen too many movies like this to be involved and excited by it. Were I half my age, with less experience of such film, I might have better things to say.

All the actors and actresses have done justice to their roles. The song at the start of initially made me feel it would be a wasted movie, but I was so wrong. Please do watch.",

    "review": "Retablo\" directed by Alvaro Delgado Aparicio and starring: Magaly Solier, Junior B\u00e9jar Roca and Amiel Cayo, set in Peru's Andes region. It's in Quechua & Spanish w/ English subtitles, released in 2018 with a duration of 1 hr. and 41 min. It has many themes from being indigenous, family, homophobia and tradition focusing on a teen, Segunfo wanting to become a master story-box or \"retablo\" maker (a traditional Peruvian cultural tradition) just like his dad, Noe.This film has also received much recognition in 2018 in creating an unique LGBTQIA+ perspective on Andean regional culture amongst indigenous or nativo cultures. The film is beautifully shot amid mountainous landscapes, with unfortunately the domestic violence that LGTBQIA+ sometime faces. It also reinstate their cultural traditions still preserved and celebrated, using the actual artistic tradition to do some of the film's storytelling.",

    "review": "It's not an easy movie for the viewer. However, it is an addictive cinema. The film is a biography of a writer who did not live to see his work published during his lifetime, so it focuses on impotence, unfulfillment and bitterness. A few days from Dovlatov's life, which we observe on the screen, is therefore a pretext for showing his everyday work - the attempts to publish a text instead of a little ambitious journalistic texts, showing his family and friends, the bohemian environment of Leningrad / St. Petersburg.The film has a very calm rhythm, it is beautifully photographed and well played. The central figure is the ubiquitous Milan Maric (strikingly similar to Sergei Dovlatov), but although he is present on the screen in almost every scene, he does not dominate history and other characters.Definitely worth seeing is a film for all those who are interested in showing the creative process on screen or in the reality of life in Soviet Russia.",

    "plot": "15 minutes into the movie, you see a Russian soldier in a trench involved in dialogue holding his rifle with bayonet attached close to his face. The style of bayonet reveals that this model in the movie is one of the original designs of Mosin Nagant which were manufactured between 1891 and 1905. It is a Mosin Nagant 91/30- 7.62x54R (1891 model) . This is one of the few if not perhaps the only WW2 movie that has this antique weapon. This model were still actually in service in WW2, but rare due to it's age and lesser accuracy (550 metres)..",
    "review": "This movie should be added to your list of \"must see\". This highly underrated movie delivers to the viewer a gripping story, within a story, within a story, within a story. Many sub-plots.The movie portrays the story of a young selfish, greedy and heartless Russian business tycoon planning a land development on a WW2 historic battle site with no care or consideration of the war dead under the soil. He plans the \"accidental death\" of a young female protester attempting to save the remains of the fallen soldiers of WW2 who is blockading the vehicles trying to enter the land. He uses deception to lure her to a place of the accident where she in turn shows him the skeletal remains of Russian soldiers in an uncovered bunker and tells him the story of their lives and sacrifice of which he shows no care or concern until he is thrust back in time to be at the actual battle field during the war. (This is the only touch of sci-fi in the movie).Waking up in the middle of the battlefield, he finds himself as like a ghost, being invisible to the soldiers fighting off the German advance, impervious to the bombardments and bullets, but thrust into the face to face sacrifice and desperation of the soldiers dying around him.Without introducing spoilers to my review, the young businessman finds himself torn between his business activities and selfish lifestyle, into that of actually learning and appreciating the sacrifice of the Soviet soldiers of WW2. In turn, he learns he is not the orphan he thought he was and has a major change of heart and appreciation of life of those before him and around him.\nThe middle of the movie becomes a bit sluggish, but thereafter it becomes quite intense and gripping. The last 20 minutes wrap up the whole story sending a very strong message of self sacrifice, caring of others and appreciation of war veterans.Military history buffs will pick up quickly that the war time scenes are that of the conclusion of the mass German advance when the Russians were losing, until the moment, the tide of war had just turned. The Russian battle location is not clear in the movie, but infers it is a mix of the battles of Stalingrad, Kursk and Sevastopol.The story reveals a younger person, not caring about the sacrifice of former soldiers in war and learning of it through family/ancestor stories are rarely reflected in movies. Coming to my mind is only \"Memorial Day (USA)\", \"The Eternal Zero (Japan)\" and \"Da 5 Bloods (USA)\"ACCURACY - The uniforms and weapons are spot-on. Of interest was seeing a soldier in a trench in close up baring a rare Mosin Nagant 91/30- 7.62x54R (1891 model), which was an antique weapon that had ceased production 1905, but were actually still in use in WW2. Small subtle accurate scenes are depicted in the movie such as the poor diet of soldiers in the bunkers and trenches and what they were actually eating..TECHNIQUE/SPECIAL EFFECTS - The off color of the scenes in the WW2 scenes are clever in showing the fantasy/dream like state of being thrust back in time.BATTLEFIELD CGI - It is not of a high or convincing quality, but I think it is not needed, nor does it detract from the movie given the above reference to Special effectsOverall, this movie is a fine piece of work and I highly recommend it.",

    "review": "Freaks starts out (or so you think) as a film which promises to deliver some uncomfortable moments between an overprotective dad who may or may not be outright crazy as well as possibly dangerous, and his cute, socially-inexperienced, defenseless and mostly awkward little girl. If you know nothing about the film going in, like we did not, upon viewing the first few scenes, naturally, your mind can't help but run to all kinds of dark places, wondering where the filmmaker is going to take us.Well, where it goes, although the ride hits a couple of small bumps, are dark and eerie places touching on the horror genre, and then surprisingly, it pulls back and takes an unexpected left turn into something completely different.Much of the supporting cast is okay, but the real revelation is the outstanding performance by Lexy Kolker as the little girl, and just slightly less-so, although still great, her dad, played by Emile Hirsch. They pretty much carry the film. Bruce Dern also delivers, if not a riveting performance, at least a mentionable and memorable one. His role in their lives unravels slowly and is not completely understood until somewhere in the middle of the film. It takes a while to discern what his purpose truly is and for the viewer to see the entire picture. I enjoyed that.I also liked that the film lets the viewer decide for themselves if what they've witnessed is abuse, trauma, or something else entirely. I also like that while I believe the characters are used as a stand-in or metaphor for discrimination, it isn't anything that is heavy-handed or overtly pushed.All in all, I found Freaks to be entertaining, and that its concept had been well-executed and delivered. The journey, despite the twists and turns, was captivating, and the destination was 99% equally pleasing and enjoyable, if not 100% where I had expected to go.",

    "review": "6/10 - Coming back after seeing this biopic of the larger-than-life Marathi politician, I am quite disappointed at how they have not done justice to this movie.Acting: First of all, Nawazuddin is the only major role in this film and others remain bystanders throughout the movie. Nawaz is probably one of the better actors in today's era and he proves it with another great performance. However, he seems uncomfortable with Marathi and falls short at the fiery roar that Balasaheb possessed. For example, when I saw Sanju, I didn't realize that it was not Sanjay Dutt acting. Such actor-character sync was missing.Yet, he was perhaps the best choice for this complex role (but would've preferred Nana Patekar or Manoj Bajpai if they were younger). Amrita Rao, while being the other major character, is non-existent and missable.Screenplay: The story, while doing a good job of taking us through Thackeray's life, did feel over the top at times (Remember that this movie was produced by Sanjay Raut, who is a part of the Shiv Sena so it excessively glorifies the character). I also hated the fact that the first half is in black&white. I mean, what's the point?However, it was really interesting to see some politically-unrelated moments of Balasaheb's life that I wasn't aware of. Some dialogues are pearls.Direction: This was the biggest let down for me. Abhijit Panse, who had previously made his debut with Rege (2014) - an absolute gem of a movie - seemed sloppy in his second (though I am not sure how much he could control things). It appeared as if he let Nawaz get away at times, but could've aimed at perfection.He also tries to tell too many things in 2 hours. I would've preferred less things but in more detail.Music: While there are no songs in this movie, background effects were really good and gave me goosebumps many times, inspiring me to pay attention to every scene.Editing: Like I mentioned, there are too many scenes, and the movie seems very fast. They should've fixed it.All in all, worth a watch, but don't have high hopes like Sanju or Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. 6/10 stars.",

Kudos for not going with a Hollywood Liam Neeson revenge fantasy, this sophisticated movie is more interested in the complex and adult reality of this man's pain and determination.

    "plot": "Based on a best-selling novel by Pidi Baiq",
    "review": "So i just found out about this movie a week before its release. I've read the books, the first and second (the main story) and i really liked it (the books), and I'm really curious how they are going to cramp 2 worth of novel to a moviel, and boy i didn't expect it to be an adaptation of the FIRST book only.First of all, the name Dilan has been very popular for the last 2 months in my country, the book itself was huge in selling and i believe 3/4 teenagers in Indonesia ranging from 13 to 24 have read the book so it is really well known. I went to watch it with my friends and we all agree that some books should not be adapted to the big screen.The PlotWhile some may disagree, i think the movie has no plot whatsoever. Yes i know, it needs to stay faithful to the novel, but not like this. It's not a story, it's a compilation of the main character's struggle to capture the heroine's heart, it has some up and down but not a conflict, no conclusion. You felt nothing, not a single accomplishment when you're finally done with the movie. Instead of doing a very close adaptation to the novel, i think the movie will be more interesting if they cramp 2 novel to a one long a*s movie, because they would have a Conflict and a Resolution to the conflict, or even better? They make it a TV series (i know the quality of some Indonesian TV shows but the recent one from NET is better). The point is, they want to milk this movie, getting the most out of it, even if they make something this ridiculous, teenagers and the novel's fan would still see it. The charactersOkay, let me get this straight, I'm not a hater of Dilan's actor as some Indonesia male teen are, but i think he's not fit to play Dilan, not because of his acting (it's okay) but for his charm. Dilan in the book is neither ugly nor handsome but this guy? Some of female teenagers in the cinema was literally screaming in awe when he get his games out (which i don't like, pls don't be that person). He is too attractive to play Dilan and i know exactly why they picked him, well how to attract female teenagers to watch it? The same formula works vice versa for Milea's actress, but i have no qualm about it because she is supposed to be beautiful. The only thing i dislike about her actress is the way she act, i think it was just a little off and sometimes you will cringe on her acting, but meh, it was probably just me.OverallThe cheesyness of the dialogue may be too hard to receive when it's your first time seeing Dilan in action (not reading the novel), but bear with it so your gf can be happy, some readers of the novel may understand (especially if you're a male) that the feel you get when reading and watching is different, so if first timers find the movie too cheesy to watch, try the novel, you'll understand why i like it more. The movie itself i think were pretty enjoyable, depends on what kind of person you are. If you're looking for a sweet romance about a girl and boy i think this movie will be enjoyable for you. But if you're looking for a deeper stories or a conflict of some kind that needs a resolution, don't bother watching it. Me personally, i kinda enjoy it because it's really faithful to the novel, but kinda disappointed too because it was the kind of movie that you'll forget when eating dinner after watching it.",

Heavily playing on the inequalities between boys and girls, women and men, in the past and in the present (sadly) - with a sweet and engaging tale at its heart but, more importantly, empowering your potential - which is limitless.There will be those that will hate this film but you'll at least recognise them from their comments and reviews but above all their scores.

There's a twist in the End which is fairly Predictable But it's Hardly an issue,although It seemed a little too stretched toward the climax.

My father attended in person the entire trial as he was in charge of the judges and their needs. He actually lived in the courthouse. (Former War Ministry). Based on his many stories and amazing memory, and long life (age 91) combined with the actual court records, this is a very historically true film. Right down to the \"issues\" different judges had. The film company did an amazing job blending actual footage (I found my dad 4 times) with new filming. Perfect acting and the accurate portrayal of emotions etc. This is the first review I have EVER written anywhere, but the truth deserves to be recognized. If this company makes future films, I will watch.A side note: Unfortunately the Nuremberg trial, being first, received all the attention. With the Tribunal of the Far East being later, and being much longer, it received little attention including films and books. Basically prior to this well-done series, there was a short documentary and later a drama staring Tommy Lee Jones called \"The Emperor\". It was about trying the emperor. From my fathers first hand experience, MacArthur made the correct decision. Although difficult as it was. Serving on General Head Quarters under MacArthur, my father would often spend Sunday afternoons in MacArther's home watching movies. (The General brought his wife). He talked about this tough decision. Regardless of the emperors awareness and/or involvement; he did have a high control over the hearts of the people. Putting the Emperor on trial carried great risk of a large scale revolt or worse. Tojo was by far the worse of all, and got what he had coming. Sadly, much later, our government gave amnesty to many of the Japanese war criminals, some of which were in hiding. Such as the \"Bird\" who beat regularly Louie Zamperini in was portrayed in the book and not as detailed movie, Unbroken.",

    "review": "I was fooled by the poster of this series with the goofy-looking characters having a good time, thinking it is a feel-good comedy. How wrong I was. Without giving away the storyline, the male and female leads are ordinary people who live their miserable lives one day after another. What is not ordinary is their humanity as they cross paths with each other, the decisions they make and the actions they take that impact the other, for better or for worse.The tone of the show is dark and at the same time we are intermittently sprinkled with rays of hope and joy till the very end. How much can you love another person, be that person your brother, son, spouse, childhood friend or... someone who was a perfect stranger until recently? How strong is your love or friendship without asking anything in return? Characters we would uncharitably reject as losers at first gradually but unequivocally become endearing to us as their life stories unfold. We feel their pain deeply. We want them to prevail and have a happier life. At the same time we understand how difficult it must be for them to break free from their past or simply from the constraints that society or the characters impose upon themselves. Despite their character flaws and their burden, none of our beloved characters demand our pity. Instead they want us to see them for who they are, to recognize their integrity and be proud of the love and friendship that binds them to each other in their neighborhood community.And what a fabulous ending that is totally in character, even if I usually dislike ambiguous endings and I do long for more between our hero and heroine. It's several days after I finished the show and yet I still wonder how they relationship will develop in their next meeting...If you rate a show based on your enjoyment after it ended and the lingering questions and thoughts it continues to provoke in you, this will have a perfect 10/10. In that respect, this is the best character-driven kdrama I have seen so far. As a matter of fact, it is among the very best shows I have seen, simply. Kudos to the directer, writer and fabulous actors.",

Those simulation scenes could have been more well performed, especially with better actors. Or they could just have not been made at all, or even be replaced by cartoon. It's interesting - even indispensable - to interview those who were directly involved in the events portrayed (the cops and the gangsters), but it would be very nice to also hear some of the people who were indirectly affected by their actions and also some experts. This series can be entertaining, but it leaves you with the feeling that something much better could have been done with its subject matter.",

    "review": "Folks go on and on about how 'fearless' a given film is in its unflinching approach to some subject or another. Sure, there are a lot of brave films making the rounds, but to me Transformer sets a new standard. This film is far from a superficial topic treatment of gender identity crisis and transformation. It is in fact a deeply personal story of the struggle to reconcile one's own identity amid manifold, countervailing forces.How does a person who has lived their life building and supporting a false identity to protect their psyche from the hatred they feel toward their own body set about building a life around who they've always yearned to be? The answer, it seems, is that nobody knows. Transformer manages to simultaneously challenge what it takes to be a man, what it means to be a woman, and what is required to be truly human.Astonishingly honest, deeply emotional, peppered with intimate takes and salted with a sawtooth wave of tiny triumphs and existential setbacks, Transformer is a documentary masterpiece for the modern age. Janae Marie Kroc is ultimately more heroine than we likely deserve, but perhaps precisely the one we need.",

In the attack, the vehicle they drove is revealed to be Tobot X, a robot their father made to protect the family. While Ryan gets Tobot X, Kory finds his own robot companion in Tobot Y, a cocky, yet speedy Tobot. Together, the two must fight evil in Daedo City wherever it threatens.Yeah, while it is an okay show, it does have it flaws. Some characters are basically annoying tropes (Diluk is the idiot henchmen, Dolly's mom is overprotective and whiny, and Officer Oh is the bumbling cop, to name a few), and some of the plots like Torbot Titan appear too quickly, but it is an okay cartoon that teaches lessons in teamwork and has plenty of action.",

At over 2 1/2 hours long the film is a bit of a tunnel, with no obvious light at the end. Bizarrely you do feel for the characters and what originally was self preservation, after 1, 2, 10, 15, 20 30 years becomes a prison of their own making.There are a lot of what appear flaws to the idea behind the film. But once you realise that these moles \"topos\" as the locals would call them where scattered all over Spain and this story is loosely based on fact, it does become quite riveting.By the end the film does become incredibly sad , when you realise what the couple have sacrificed over the years. Is a worthy watch, but probably could have been a lot shorter.",

    "review": "This was such a struggle to get through, and very unrewarding for doing so.Since I've read the book, I knew what was going on. I also had no idea what was going on. Kaufman's adaptation was so bizarre and unforthcoming that it had me constantly checking how much time was left (too much was the answer)..The first 20 something minutes are PAINFULLY slow, and the chemistry between the two main characters is so nonexistent yet they supposedly have this super deep connection. The character of Jake was so flat and mumbly - nothing like the sophisticated intellectual he was in the novel, but I tried to push that out of my mind. I was rapidly losing interest when the two finally arrived to Jake's parent's house, and there was a moment where I truly thought this movie was going to be incredible. Suddenly I was questioning what I was seeing, the unnervingly strange exchange between characters was unsettling and dread started creeping up in my chest. It stirred up the kind of uneasy feelings I got during my first viewing of Hereditary.I'm a huge fan of strange movies that feel like a bad dream, not a nightmare necessarily, but a dream where things make sense but don't at the same time, and you have a pit in your stomach but don't know why. I like subtle strangeness, enough to pique your interest without beating you over the head with it. Unfortunately there quickly came a point when this movie catapulted over that fine line and became so frustratingly bizarre. It felt like it was trying to be Mulholland Drive. I am all for a strange trip of a movie but it has to be coherent enough to make sense in some way. If I didn't read the book I would have no idea what this movie meant or what was really happening, it just became too ridiculous for me to enjoy.I presume people will talk about how bizarre it is on social media which will make people curious enough to watch it, but it was so unsatisfying and an overall waste of time.",

It won't be easy though; the air must be filtered due to toxic spores and anybody they encounter is unlikely to be friendly. Things go wrong from the start; their lander is damaged as they enter the atmosphere and they miss their intended landing site by some way. An early encounter leaves Cee on her own; if she is to survive and get off the moon again she will have to make an unlikely alliance.I rather enjoyed this film; it might not be a classic and was clearly made for a relatively small amount but the story is solid in a fairly simply way. It may be set on a distant moon but the plot could come straight from a western. It is somewhat episodic with our protagonist facing a series of dangers that she must overcome but that isn't a problem. The tension is kept fairly high as there is always some danger to be overcome. The small cast does a solid job; most obviously Sophie Thatcher who really impressed as Cee; a character who toughens up nicely as she overcomes various dangers. Also notable are Pedro Pascal as Ezra and Jay Duplass as Damon. There aren't too many special effects but those that there are are pretty good in an unshowy way. The setting looks good; the forest being lush but also somewhat claustrophobic; one can't help feeling it would be easy to get lost there. Overall an enjoyable little sci-fi that is well worth watching.",

INSANE. That the movie is pretty damn enjoyable on the whole feels like a minor miracle, but here we are. I liked it! When the pretty clever ending setup a direct sequel? I was excited!

It tells the story of a girl who ventures into the online game and becomes a whirlwind sensation with her abnormally tiny and overwhelming cute avatar.The story is oddly dark in places but softened up with cutesy visuals and Lenns sickly sweet voice. The action is excellent and frequent and it's very well paced which is something you certainly can't say about SAO!I really enjoyed this and would love to see Lenn and co back.

    "review": "When this Hong Kong show popped up on Netflix recently, it caught my eye immediately, though I was a little reluctant to start watching it because looking at the episode list, it would require viewers to make a 30 episode commitment. But I decided to take a look at the first episode, though a little reluctantly. The first episode was interesting enough to make me decide to give the second episode a look. By the end of the second episode, I was hooked on this show. I have now watched about 60% of the episodes, and the show continues to be great. Yes, I will admit that the show is not perfect. It's definitely not a fast paced show, and there isn't that much action. Also, there are some plot points and plot threads that will be very familiar to those who have seen their share of other cop shows. But as familiar as the writing might get on occasion, it is always executed in a way that keeps you riveted and interested. One reason for that is that the characters are very memorable. The good guys are not perfect, but you understand their mistakes, and you sympathize with them. And while the bad guys are definitely deserving of punishment, they often have some dimension to them that does not make them clear-cut bad people. As a bonus, the Hong Kong backdrop gives this show a lot of freshness, and you get to learn a lot about Hong Kong culture and life. I'm looking forward very much to watching the remaining 40% of the episodes. Catch this show while it's on Netflix, because it probably won't be there forever!",

So Carmen does so and ends up in 2019. All is well but for the fact that soon after arriving and finding the witch to send her back, that witch disappears and is presumed dead. How does she get back now?There are several problems with this series that might not bug you but bugged me. (1) for some reason, everyone on the show has the dialog dubbed. This makes everyone sound ridiculous. You will have an obviously latino man speaking like a white car commercial from the 1970s. It is horrible; (2) There is way too much talking about the baddie. They must say his name a zillion times but a lot of the story doesn't seem to advance the ball toward finding him; (3) there is just a modern day problem with this show... Carmen is a slave in 1600 and is in *love* with the slave master's son. It is hard for anyone in modern day to root for them to get together in the 1600s. You kind of want Carmen to stay where she is.I do want to give them credit for doing a good job with someone from the 1600s coming to 2019. Carmen has problems adjusting but they are not over done. She learns fast and makes friends. I would put this in the watch for later queue.",

It does not immediately investigate the \"water crisis\" like one would likely expect. Instead, it communicates the real problem at hand, the hostility between a community and its cities officials. This series does not stop there. It constantly holds your attention, refusing to be anything like similar series' where the same content is repeated episode after episode. The second a certain topic in \"Flint Town\" begins to sour a completely new position is introduced and examined - exactly how the media should be. This isn't about taking sides. This is about hearing every single voice in the community and determining what the best solution is to improve the level of comfort and safety felt in the community. In satisfying this mission they complete another objective without any intention, leading viewers to the realization that maybe the government isn't 'really' out to get them - maybe it's really their fellow citizens.Overall I must give this series a solid 10/10.

So I can see both sides. This show is really funny. Not laugh out loud funny, but much more subtle and basically making fun of how politically correct we've become as a society in the US. France is still a very face value country, where you just live and enjoy living. This is not a knock on the US, I love living here, but in some respect, we've gone too far. You literally can't say anything without being afraid of offending someone.\nThis show is all about exactly that. The contrast between different cultures. It pokes fun at both, and does not take itself too seriously.\nI almost never write reviews. But I wanted this show to be given it's fair shake. And yes, I do like Gad. Too better get this show, I recommend you watch the Gad special on Netflix beforehand, and you'll appreciate this show even more. It's an insight into American culture as viewed from the outside.\nNetflix, awesome job coming up with totally different shows versus a rinse and repeat formula that we've seen time and time again.\nRegarding Gad speaking in the third person, it's simply Gad poking fun at himself, nothing more. He's acting as Gad. Love the Seinfeld cameo as well.",

    "review": "Netflix's Twelve Forever has an interesting albeit familiar premise, a modernized retelling of the Peter Pan story about a trio of middle schoolers who travel to a magical dimension to escape reality and eventual maturity where imagination is limitless and they have superpowers. Unfortunately, that last sentence pretty much covers it as far as depth is concerned, as the series often illustrates that the creators really did not put that much thought into beyond the idea for it.Not long in it becomes quite apparent that this was meant to be for Cartoon Network as its trying to replicate the 'fantastical sitcom' approach of Adventure Time and Steven Universe, however its tonal balance is very uneven; sometimes they try to go big with the laughs, big with the drama, but it doesn't gel all well together. Almost every episode feels like it was based on a first draft...The world, or in this case the island of, Endless is interesting but its all too random and doesn't have any cohesion or rules. And most of its inhabitants come across as rejects from Adventure Time.Reggie, the lead character of the show, comes across like a brat a lot of the time and isn't very easy to latch onto. She and her friends all lack chemistry and do not play off of each other well to engage a viewer much.Not the worst show ever, but more time in the writer's room needs to be spent for it really kick into high gear. Too bad they had to redo everything from the Cartoon Network short from a few years prior - it was a lot better and more thought out.",

At that dinner she roundly excoriated Donald Trump, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and a press upon whose laziness and craven need for Internet-era relevance she directly placed blame for Trump's ascension. Her performance could well be responsible for the White House Correspondents Association's decision to change the format in subsequent dinners, replacing the comedian with a staid historical commentator.",
    "review": "At this point in my review, her show has only one episode that aired just days ago. I followed her stand-up comedy prior to her notorious appearance as the host of the 2018 White House Correspondents Dinner. It seems like many people just know her for just that and not her previous comedy. Because of the WHCD, it seems like her comedy is polarizing for many. To clarify her previous comedy, she has a great deal of jokes revolving around her voice. It's screechy and annoying, but part of her act. Anyone shocked to hear it on her new show clearly have never seen her stand-up routines. Now for her new show:\nIt isn't all that bad and it is in need of improvement. Her jokes are raunchy, which is entirely within her normal comedy routines. Her comedy is much like many of the great comics in the form of shock comedy. It is meant to push the lines, and make you laugh and widen your eyes to how much it pushes the boundaries. That was the good part of it.The DJ (why?):\nThe DJ is introduced in her monologue. All he is good for in the entirety of the show is to nod, smile and laugh at times while on camera. That's it. This really seems like the producers wanted to make the show seem more like nightly live television shows like Fallen, Colbert and Kimmel. However, this show is just 30 minutes long and once a week. There is no need for DJ personality other than to fill in time. This show is on Netflix, so there aren't commercial breaks where the audience is just sitting for dead time. The DJ is a forgettable character.The break-away segments:\nI'll just come out and say her show is trying to be the female version of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver with these break-away segments. Last Week kills it with their break-away segments, but The Break falls short. The CGI graphics for effects are horrible. Two of the three break-away segments were forgettable.Overall:\nThough the show has only one episode, it does need improvements. It's a half hour that could benefit from some pruning of needless things. There is no need for a DJ. The break-away segments need better writing and execution. This isn't a daily show, so these issues shouldn't be too hard to address.",

    "review": "Paddleton is a simple movie. The story is contained, the cinematography plain, and the premise unoriginal. This is all clearly by design. The two main characters, played by Mark Duplass and Ray Romano, are weird, awkward people and they are always presented as they are, ordinary. They live in small apartments one on top of the other. They are single and work simple jobs. They have terrible diets and watch terrible movies. And one of them happens to be very ill.While it may seem like a criticism for me to call this movie plain and unoriginal, it really is not. Paddleton is not a canvas for some artsy filmmaker to paint with. It is not excessively dramatized or colorful or whimsical. It is what it is, an honest character study of two people. Often the silver screen is reserved for the interesting and the bold, the odd and sometimes depraved, people that seem to merit attention. These two characters are not like that. They are tiny, seemingly insignificant, and each actor melts into their respective personalities. The relationship between the two feels honest and they come across as true friends on the screen. Not to take anything away from Mark Duplass, but Ray Romano really steals most of the scenes they have together. He plays an aging, banal, and single man scarily well.There are some things I did not like, the music was a bit twee and contained mostly ethereal melodies and simple keys that did not always fit the tone of the accompanying scene. Some of the dialogue felt stilted. But really everything besides the two performances is just window dressing. This is a film about their relationship and the circumstance they must face together. The low budget feel works to focus the viewers attention on these two people, it makes it feel real.\nWe all have to face death in our lives, but we have each other to depend on.Friendship is such a precious commodity that we often take for granted. It's the little things, like seeing each other on a commute to work, that become noticeable once gone. Paddleton pays homage to the beauty of ordinary life, and reminds us that this finite bit of time we have been given will eventually come to an end. It does not try to prescribe meaning it cannot possible know, it does not romanticize the process, it just is what it is, and in that way it becomes a worthwhile experience.",

And yet, the characters and the story got me hooked within 15 minutes and I binge-watched to the end. Character development is beautiful and slow, timing is impeccable, drama is balanced with light comedy in an effortless way, every single actor is well cast and executes perfectly. And most of all, it is incredibly refreshing to see sensible \"normal\" people compared to all these overly egoistic and egocentric characters in American blockbusters that are only motivated by money, sex, violence, power... I probably should add that I am a hopeless romantic who watches Casablanca every few years and still enjoys it every time. If you fall into this category, no matter what else you like or dislike I highly recommend this series. Also if you are interested in Asian cultures or have never been to Korea you will probably learn a lot. The reason why I started using Netflix was Sense8. And this series also has the tenderness and \"love conquers all\" message but without the sex scenes obviously :-)",

    "review": "Gets off to a rough start, because for the first 20 or so minutes, it doesn't really present criticisms of its subject, doesn't provide much of her background at all, and really seems to just follow her around her life and make her seem sympathetic.I found her actions were a little more understandable (though perhaps sympathetic would be a stretch) when the background context was finally provided, and they do have interviewees and stock footage (eventually) to show how and why Black people have a problem with her actions. I think they could have gone a little harder with showing more of these criticisms, but it is interesting to balance that with some sympathetic moments and leave it up to the audience to decide.It's the fact that she is the first high profile person to commit to being \"trans race\" that makes her case unprecedented and divisive. I can recognise she doesn't think that choice was harmful, but in cases like this, I think you do have to listen to what others say, and if a good number of Black people give good reasons as to why they have a problem with it, you should listen and stop doing the offending behaviour.Still, the multiple perspectives and fairly neutral tone of the documentary did make it a little more interesting. Otherwise, the slow start and competent but unimpressive presentation does weigh it down a bit.Like all documentaries about controversial subjects, I could definitely understand someone watching this and hating every minute of it, but for me personally, I thought it a solid, sometimes quite interesting, but certainly far from great watch about a topic/subject that, to my knowledge, no other film or documentary has covered.",

The concept, though good, fails in execution.The main problem was Sonam Kapoor. She CANNOT act. A role which could've pulled you in, made you feel for her, for her struggles just feels... meh. She doesn't understand the nuances of the character, there is no honesty in her performance. It feels like she did the role just to do something \"different.\" And that's a loss since she doesn't have the acting capability to shoulder a character like Sweety. I could easily name a dozen actresses who could have played Sweety with conviction. The film is also slow and the climax was a bit too dramatic.The best part of the movie is the supporting cast. Be it Anil, the brother, the helpers, Regina, Juhi and the best- Rajkumar. Everyone puts their best foot forward to delve in their characters. But since the limelight is on Sonam, only having a good supporting cast doesn't solve the problem.I am very disappointed with the film.

I did want to hear more about some of the people once I met them, like the judges who used ambiguous phrasing about their marriage status.

Characters seamlessly interact with the environment and there is movement to their interactions with the world and elements around them. My kids love this one and are excited for season 2",

    "review": "Popping up on Netflix with their usual amount of pre-publicity (ie, virtually none), it's strange to think that a Steven Soderbergh movie can be dropped on the masses with little fanfare. But this is the streaming world we live in now. Styled somewhat as the basketball version of Moneyball, this fast-talking drama delves into the big-money business side of the sport - \"the game on top of the game\" - during a patience-testing lockout. Heavy on dialogue and light on explanation, Tarell Alvin McCraney's script is frustratingly oblique and borderline pretentious. The passion is clearly there, especially about bringing the sport back to its roots, but when everyone talks in riddles it becomes hard to care who wins and who loses. Soderbergh directs with minimal fuss, the entire film being shot on an iPhone (albeit with a relatively hefty post-production budget). He injects a few panning shots and scene transition effects, but otherwise lets his actors do most of the heavy lifting. Andre Holland (Moonlight) is decent as next-level agent Ray Burke and Zazie Beetz (Deadpool 2) is charismatic as his eager offsider, however it's Hollywood veteran Bill Duke (Predator) who shines brightest as an aging, old-school youth basketball coach who is endearingly stubborn. Unfortunately those on the other side of the equation, such as Kyle MacLachlan's team owner and Zachary Quinto's corporate higher-up, are one-dimensional stereotypes; disappointingly low-hanging fruit for the movie to target. There's a great movie - or better yet, a stage play - in here somewhere, but in its current form High Flying Bird is exasperatingly inaccessible.",

Unfortunately, I would not call it a kids movie at all.

The acting is okay for the most part, with only a handful of examples of egregiously bad performance, and in most of those instances, I would wager it was the result of the poor writing and direction.As others have pointed out, the vfx are not stellar, but I am going to assume that this was done on a very small budget, with the bulk of the budget going to some of the cameos and gaining access to some of the locations.The real issue with this film, however, is that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to do. One minute it seems to be a tongue in cheek commentary on the film industry, poking fun at typical movie tropes, the next it seems to want to be a \"stranger things\" type nostalgia trip (somehow set in modern day, but surrounded by props from every modern time period except today). Then other times it seems to be trying desperately to be a comedy, despite there being zero humor in the script.It's not the worst film ever made by any stretch, but it is definitely a forgettable film that you will see listed somewhere a year or two from now and think \"that sounds interesting\" until you start watching and then realize you've already seen it.",

Other myths have her becoming the 'Lady of the Lake' who raised Sir Lancelot, returning Excalibur to King Arthur and, eventually, taking his body to the realm of Avalon. (The two variations, however, seldom exist in the same telling of the story.)",

And, yes, some of them did fall out but their coming back together depicts real life well and shows us the meaning of humanity.And I cannot disagree with a lot of reviewers who said this series was a few episodes too many. And I get the disparity between the emotionality of the mother language of those actors who are Israeli and those who are South American when it is dubbed into English and whatever language you are watching it in your country.But this is to take from Netflix bringing mainly great drama to the masses. You can't have it every way.I sometimes think viewers overlook the central theme of a drama series or film by being too narrow in their judgment of the acting, script, direction, plot holes and yes, language dubbing. Criticise these if you must but always bear in mind the bigger picture.And no pun intended.",

    "review": "I can understand the confusing reviews probably come from a mindset of expectation from the movie, considering Iliza was in it.Although many including myself may have looked forward to a goofy, lighthearted laugh, I have to say the story had an abstract depth to it from a psychological point of view. In some ways it touched on some serious issues some of us deal with in relationships, not realizing the overtness in agendas of partners in them. In some ways also, the elephant in the room was addressed. Full marks for that.That said, I'm not sure if the director even realized the power of the script. I felt as a movie, this was all over the place because it touched on so many different societal issues.Maybe the focus could have been on narcissism and how to deal with the trauma it brings to those who don't realize it. Maybe this could have just been one of Iliza's (love her to bits) stand up episodes, I don't know.Watch it if you're able to switch your expectations. It's a good one with a very important message. Don't watch it if you're expecting tears from guffaws.This is a strange one. I liked it though.",

    "review": "Emotionally devastating yet reassuringly empathetic, director Lukas Dhont's GIRL tells the story of transgender ballerina Lara as she seeks to complete her transition while struggling to achieve her dreams. Make no mistake, this is a tough film to watch (as exemplified by the cringing noises and gasps from the elderly women sitting in the row behind me), but it's also a rewarding one. Victor Polster delivers some of the best work of the year in his portrayal of the protagonist, and while some will rightly be bothered by the fact that Polster is a cisgender male actor who cannot ever known firsthand the difficulties that someone like Lara would have gone through her entire life, he nonetheless delivers an arresting, sensitive performance that adroitly examines these devastating struggles. And while the film does focus a fair amount on the struggles that Lara faces through her transition, it also highlights her resilience and courage, which define her more than anything else. I also have to point out that it's been a landmark year for movie dads, with Arieh Worthalter fitting right in with Michael Stuhlbarg's dad from CALL ME BY YOUR NAME, Josh Hamilton's dad from EIGHTH GRADE, and Tracy Letts' dad from LADY BIRD. Worthalter shines as a devoting father who desires nothing more than his daughter's happiness.If there's one thing I disliked about GIRL, however, it's the slow pacing, which I really started to feel during the last fifteen minutes of the film or so. It's only 105 minutes long but each and every minute is certainly felt. I also wasn't the biggest fan of Dhont cutting the music off during certain scenes (let the scene play out, Dhont!). Despite my complaints and the fact that I might not have loved GIRL, I still certainly believe it's worth watching.",

    "review": "I get what people are saying here... Let's set that aside for a minute however. The visuals are absolutely stunning first off... I imagine many 4k screensavers will become intertwined into the \"deep web\" of people's PC's in due time... This alone makes the \"documentary,\" as it were, worth your time...I think what people are missing out on is just how vital to the ecosystem mushrooms are... Not many people in this day and age that I've met seem to be getting the same kind of education that was given out in classrooms during the 70's and 80's. To reach people you have to give them a sense of hope, positivity and something worth reaching for. This documentary does that WELL...First off, a little background: my son's mother is heavily into herbal medicine and I've learned and SEEN firsthand the dramatic healing effects of herbs and plant (and mushroom based) medicines... Someone I know contracted spinal meningitis which, if you know ANYTHING about this, has a less than 5% survival rate. Not only did she survive, but what she carried into this made all but certain she would be one of the less than 5%... It is a dramatic story that STILL has the doctors baffled to this day, and something she knew and took for granted.The stories in this \"documentary\" are TRUE... I have read the reports of mushrooms that cleaned up oil spills in the Gulf. The utilization of mycelium threads to create batteries could have a revolutionary and profound change in the microchip industry, something that technological companies are having troubles with at this moment (I am an amateur stock trader as well, so I read the news reports every day). And the altered states of consciousness? Well, some of these guys might seem like \"old druggie hippies,\" but what would have given this documentary even MORE credibility would have been to mention the Native American Indians who utilized mushroom teas for clarity and insight.It's a biased slant to be sure on the part of some of these reviewers, but they seem to be poo-poo'ing decades of quality scientific research. Research papers that I personally have read and studied... In an era where we allow presidents to call scientists with 10 and 15 year studies and masters and bachelor's degrees \"stupid,\" sadly it speaks to just how far gone we as a species have gone. When we celebrate stupidity rather than enlightened, knowledgeable learning and scientific discovery.Mushrooms are amazing pieces of creation. They help keep life going and have for millions, maybe even billions, of years. Yes, cutting down endless amounts of trees is not going to help this planet, but at least we can seemingly be assured in the knowledge that long after we're gone, the 'shrooms will still be here.Movies like this are designed to get you to \"do more research...\" I stopped the movie several times to research and look up the various mushrooms talked about, just to see and learn more for myself. You could ironically consider this movie a \"gateway\" into a LITERAL underground world that most people walk by and never even consider.And to those claiming this movie is \"political?\" The movie did an EXCELLENT job of showing how politics kills off scientific innovation and discovery. This has happened MANY times in our past, and keeps humanity stuck in the dark ages. Let us not forget what happened to the mathematicians like Hypatia who discovered long ago that earth moves in an elliptical orbit around the sun, challenging rigid and unnecessary religious dogma saying the sun revolves around the Earth (hint, Hypatia was murdered by the church). Or more recently, how the Bush administration outlawed stem cell research when it had the potential to save millions of lives and impact humanity in a meaningful way.",

    "review": "This movie was well shot, well acted, and the special effects were adequate. The plot, action, and horror were all just missing for the majority of the movie. The story is really simple, it's centered around a small Jewish community in Europe during the 1700's when a bout of plague starts ravaging a neighboring community of Catholic's. The Catholic's blame the plague on Jewish \"magic\" basically because their community was left untouched due to how remote and segregated their lifestyles are.Well an angry mob of Catholic's arrive with a very sick child and demand the Jewish folk cure her or face death. One of the towns folk takes it upon herself to summon the Golem, an ancient protector formed out of clay and tasked with defending the Jewish people. Which it...kinda does?So far everything is fine, simple and easy to understand as that's essentially the whole plot. The problem is almost NOTHING happens for the majority of the movie and it's extremely slow paced. When the \"horror\" finally happens there's only about 10 minutes of movie left and they rush right through it without showing much of it. And then it ends.So not terrible, but that's the best review I can personally write without giving any spoilers. It's watchable but you're not missing anything if you skip it.",

I was the biggest Kelz fan before the tape and afterwards I admit I wanted to forget what I saw and forgive and pray he got his life back on track. But now after knowing and realizing he is a serial pedophile predator we have to ban anything and everything he tries to do. He won't stop because he can't and he trys to ask for support from the black community meanwhile he's abusing our young queens. Starvation, Desolation, Slapping, Verbal degrading. He's a monster and anyone pushing back against that reality is complicit in aiding a deceitful predator. It's never ok but it's one thing to treat grown woman a certain way because they will process your sickness faster and figure a way to get away from the madness, but under age girls haven't got a chance most will fold under those pressures. This docu-series was sincere and very well crafted the only person who should feel shame to tell this story is the one who is denying it. Robert Kelly who shows no remorse admits it on a 19 minute song but then says he's not a pedophile on the same song. He married a 15yo. When he was 27. Case closed.",

The hardest part to listen to was the lack of concern people had for protecting a domestic violence survivor. I tried to tell myself that this was because the show was set in the past and perhaps something got lost in English translation but by the end their was no doubt in my mind that their is only so far a liberal view they are willing to show.

It's not what Abby expected as more people show up.Everybody is trying to be wacky and it ends being rather annoying. The consent lesbian is a little funny for about two seconds. Kat Dennings has her sarcastic moments. All in all, those moments are few and fleeting. These characters get wackier and more annoying. Maybe... just maybe, Abby and Molly could build up some more friendship chemistry at the beginning which would carry on to a compelling evolution towards the end. It all boils down to filmmaker Nicol Paone. I have to question her directing skills. She really needs to do a few more rewrites before putting anything on film.",

Certainly not.I have a lot of tolerance for low budget production, but not when there is no redeeming positive factor.

This is not a film about race or the differences in race or the difficulties of adjusting to living in a new country, it's not trying to say anything about the immigration system it's just telling a story that happens to involve new immigrants to a country, saying this is a commentary on immigration is like saying Jaws is a commentary on water safety or Die Hard 2 is a commentary on airport security.This film is a supernatural horror about the desperate things that people will do to survive and the consequences of those actions, and it's one of the most entertaining horrors I've seen for a while with some genuinely unsettling scenes, I can only hope people don't dismiss it because of a few ignorant reviewers who see imaginary agendas whenever there are black characters leading a film.8/10",

    "review": "Having followed Ferm\u00edn Muguruza's music during much of my teenage years, I was quite excited to see what he could do as a film director in Black is Beltza. That is the reason why it pains me to say that this is one of the absolute worse films I have seen in my life, and there is no reason why you should watch it. With the exception of a decent (but not great) soundtrack, everything about Black is Beltza is pathetically bad.\nThe thing that stands out most from the beginning of the film is the voice acting. It almost seems as if Ferm\u00edn Muguruza has hired his worst enemy to be the casting director for the film, that is how laughable some of the choices are. One of the main characters, a member of the Black Panthers from New York, is voiced by an (otherwise very talented) actor from the Ivory Coast. Not only does he not have a New York accent; at points it sounds like he struggles to pronounce certain words. Another character, a woman from Cuba, is voiced by a woman who has the emotion and cadence of someone reading out the instructions of her new food processor. Then there is a Texan character voiced by the usually great Sergi L\u00f3pez, who is completely unable of pulling a Texan accent. And the highlight: a character from Qu\u00e9bec, voiced by an actor who probably doesn't speak a word of French, and who tries to pull off a Qu\u00e9becois accent by combining some awful French with an even worse American accent. Even non-Francophones at my local cinema were laughing out loud at how terrible his accent was.\nAnother important issue with this film has to do with its portrayal of women and Spaniards - something that is particularly worrying coming from director Muguruza, who has made a career out of preaching about feminism and anti-racism. There are four women with relatively important roles in this film: two of them are only there to sleep with the main character, one of them is an Algerian minister who of course has enormous breasts and a cleavage to match, and an Israeli spy, who barely says anything in the entire film.\nSpanish people get an arguably worse treatment from Muguruza. While all Basques in the film are somewhere between nice and heroic, and so are most other characters, Muguruza seems to have a problem with Spaniards. He portrays a Spain full of racist Francoists, who are not only racist and violent but also terribly dumb. Throughout the entire film, not a single Spanish character does or says anything positive, and they are all so one-dimensional that it becomes hard to believe what Muguruza is trying to tell us.\nFinally, the story itself is worth mentioning. Mostly because it is just as bad, if not worse, as the voice acting. In one of the first scenes, a man says that the is impressed by the protagonist's boxing skills, even though we have never seen, or heard about, the protagonist boxing. That is the end of the boxing references, but the awful script-writing will follow us throughout the duration of the film. From that moment on, Black is Beltza is a story about a Basque man travelling to the USA, Cuba, Mexico, Algeria and Qu\u00e9bec, being welcomed into the highest echelons of revolutionary movements in each location for no apparent reason, and being told by everyone around him that Basques are great and that if the Basques hadn't helped country X, then country X would never have become independent and free like it is today. In the meantime, the protagonist fights and/or runs away from three very bad guys who just happen to come from the three countries that represent Muguruza's particular axis of terror: Spain, the USA, and Israel. And the reason why these characters insist on chasing the protagonist? Muguruza does not feel the need to explain this to the audience, and the closest thing we get to an explanation is that one of the bad guys wants to steal a trumpet from a friend of the main character.\nTo conclude: if you find yourself thinking about watching Black is Beltza, stop yourself now! This is an awful, awful film, and a total waste of time.",

    "review": "Cooking on High is a new Netflix show is about two chefs preparing the best dish with marijuana in it. Here are the reasons why this is the worst cooking show I have ever seen, based solely on the first episode:Cringe. Cringe everywhere in this show.The people judging the food have no cooking experience! One of them is a rapper that says that he cooks by making cereal and has never eaten fish before! Why do I care what these people think about food?Remember the part where the contestants run into the pantry to grab food for their dishes? Nope, here they have all the pre-portioned ingredients already assembled in front of them. Boring.The kitchen is hilariously small, and the judges just talk about what they're doing right in front of them. No private commentary.15 minutes is really not a lot of time to get much cooking done. Also missing: the countdown clock and the sense of urgency.Anyone who has ever cooked with weed knows that a key part is making the canna-butter or cannabis oil as potent as possible without burning out the THC. There are different techniques and recipes, and here they could have shown what the chefs like to do: cooking temp, time, type of weed, amount. Instead, both chefs are given the same type of weed and ostensibly the exact same canna-butter. Literally the main part of the show that sets it apart, and it is given little attention except for a lame bit about the specific strain of weed being used.Both of the judges are clearly stoned before tasting the dishes. How are they supposed to tell how potent the food is? They do take a break at some point to let the weed digest, but since both chefs are using the same canna-butter, there is no way to tell them apart.God, I hate everyone on this show besides the chefs, who seem nice enough.",

One of those artists is Eddie Murphy who now brings Rudy Ray Moore on screen, a man who even influenced Rap and the way it developed. Murphy is fantastic and easily gives the best performance of his career. He really nailed the role and was able to completely vanish into that character. A very award worthy turn and great comeback for him. Another comeback story is Wesley Snipes who is absolutely hilarious and self ironic. Never thought he had that in him and that gives me the feeling his comedic and also dramatic talent was wasted all those years before. Another noteworthy and beautiful turn was done by Da'Vine Joy Randolph. The film itself had a very realistic and colorful look with nice production design and great costume work. The screenplay was very good as was the direction of Craig Brewer. It perfectly mixes comedic elements with dramatic moments and in its result is a very respectful and faithful biopic. Definitely worth to see and another winner feature for Netflix. Watch out for Eddie Murphy in this Oscar race. At least a Golden Globe nomination should be a given.",

In tow are two of his friends (And I use that term loosely) and they discover the property might be haunted.It's brand of humor is a strange one, namely it's very very camp and the whole movie comes across rather homo-erotic considerably throughout. Taking a step back and looking at the film I do not think that was even remotely intentional either.The film has its laughs, but most are so silly and childish they'll appeal to children yet the horror is certainly not appropriate for them. For this reason the movie falls into a very strange limbo where I'm not sure who the demographic is!Most of the movies characters are deeply annoying which is exacerbated by the previously mentioned puerile comedy.It's an odd little film and it's not bad, it's just excessively goofy and I have no idea who it was really made for.The Good:Some funny momentsThe Bad:A lot of it gets real old real fastJust plain sillyAnnoying charactersThings I Learnt From This Movie:I've never used a hot spring and would like to rectify that!Woolen knee pads and fingerless mittens are adorable and need to be a thing for all girls",

Actors can't act when their direction and writing are awful. Come on Netflix. U can do better. Dark was so good in German. The writing is worse than a lifetime movie. Get it together and don't feature it as an \"original\".",

They throw in a twist or two to make it interesting (that you'll probably see coming), but it doesn't take away from the enjoyment. Wahlberg & Duke have a great chemistry together, both have some funny moments, and along with Arkin, its what sells the movie and will keep you watching.The choreography in the fight scenes is also good. It looks very raw and authentic. The bathroom & restaurant brawls are the standouts. The only negative is that the fights scenes throughout the first hour or so are all very quick. All are under 2 minutes, and feel like they could (and should) have gone on longer.Overall, I'd recommend giving it a watch",

The storyline might be a little foreseeable and the plot twist at the end is a little too much, but that's not what it's really about. This movie gives you an insight on hard living conditions in Ghana and the reality of a lot of people, especially women, without dramatizing too much. Instead, it puts an emphasis on the day-to-day life and willingness/necessity to fight for survival, which is very well played by the main actress. A immersion in another world which makes you reflect about inequalities as well as violence against women and children. I definitely recommend this movie.",

In other words, the lead character is a 30-something male, bored with life with a steady girlfriend, who decides to have a fling with a female high schooler. I'm not sure which culture would find this premise acceptable.But for some reason, as long as the lead character is female, then it's OK and we go into a fantasy storyline.As depicted in the story, the female lead is just bored of the mundane life she's leading and so goes looking for a hot, underaged pickup. Again, imagine if this was a male lead--any sympathies then?Then we get into the psychologies of the various characters. I cannot fathom how the 30-something female lead acts like a 30 year old. She's more like a stunted 20 year old. Unhappy with life, she is not able to talk with her boyfriend about their relationship issues and instead decides to have a fling. Doesn't this sound more like what a high schooler or college couple would do?As with many J-dramas these days, the original story came from a manga series that's geared towards young female audiences. Hence the main female lead feels like a 20 year old.",

As it was in (Ready Player One) by Steven Spielberg, this idea was represented in a beautiful funny story in (Ready Player One)The dialogue was bad, super cringe and full of cliches\n(What could is it being fearless in a fake world, it's time to start being fearless out here) that poetic sentence would come from a kid? it was so cringe hearing sentences and speeches like thisAll the characters were bad for their own reasons.\nThe villain was ridiculous and not frightening at all, He doesn't even have any power!\nGeneral Blazerhatch was annoying, you know that military caricature character with all its cliches? yeah exactly like what did come in your mind now.\nThat hero in the poster, Light whatever, it was the most useless character I have ever seen in an animated movie.The movie is really time-wasting, I didn't like it at all.",

    "review": "Historical documentaries often chronicle lifestyles of many decades ago, often centuries: the Roaring 20's, the Fabulous 50's, the Civil War. Because the world is changing so rapidly, particularly in the area of media, what seemed cultural mainstays only one or two decades ago are now referred to as by-gone eras. By-gone eras are no longer a half-century ago or longer. In this case, the documentary is focusing on Blockbuster Video, a cultural phenomenon mainly experienced by Gen X'ers from circa 1990 to 2010.The interviewees discuss Blockbuster Video in ways that remind me of my grandparents talking about malt shops, horse-racing tracks or Coney Island. Blockbuster Video, began with a single store in 1985 and by 2004 was at its height with about 7500 stores US nationwide. However, by 2019, there was only one store left. What happened? The most interesting part of the documentary is the history of Blockbuster which is only about a third of the film at best. Most of the film is the interviewees talking about Blockbuster culture and the last Blockbuster Video still standing in Bend, Oregon. A lot of focus is on the general manager of the last store, Sandi Harding.When I was at university in the 1990's, everyone I knew had a Blockbuster Video card. It was the culture for Gen-X'er film entertainment in lieu of going to see a new release in the theater. But even young mom's and dad's could rent movies for the whole family. New video releases were astronomically expensive, often costing $80 to $100 on VHS. But you could rent them for $3 to $5 for one to two nights at Blockbuster. You could gather a group, order pizza and watch the original \"Halloween\", \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\", or maybe a new release on video like \"Silence of the Lambs\". Or something nostalgic like \"Plan Nine from Outer Space\".According to the documentary, Blockbuster wasn't exactly put out of business by Netflix as the conventional wisdom goes. But if you listen carefully, BB was in a way. But bad business decisions contributed.BB was bought by Viacom which intended the video rental franchise as a cash cow to buy other media corporations such as the QVC Network. By then BB's stock price was slipping. BB was also offered a lucrative deal with Warner Bros for the upcoming explosion of DVD's which would replace VHS. The offer was tremendous: exclusive rights to distribute new release DVD's for rental before general sale. BB turned it down. Subsequently, Warner Bros lowered its new releases' prices from $80/$100 to $20 to $30. Now instead of renting for $4, consumers could just buy DVD's and own them forever.In the early 2000's, BB had the opportunity to buy Netflix. That was turned down. And now they're down to one last store in Bend, Oregon. An interesting doc which chronicles a by-gone era... of only like 10 years ago? We live in interesting time...",

The female lead isn't really developed at all in terms of us getting to know her character other than she's in school to be a lawyer. We knew predictably exactly where things were going to go with the boyfriend. I don't even need to share spoilers! It would have been nice to have a story that was unexpected and still uplifting.

    "review": "This is the 3rd season of Bridgertons and I'm tired. New shiny costumes, elaborate sets, pretty ppl, soothing music, that's about it for this show. The only book i liked from the series was book 2 and that was unnecessarily butchered in the name of drama in season 2.I am not much for historical accuracy as I don't have vast knowledge on British History, but i do care for a bit of logic, a bit of beautiful performances and a bit of beautiful making. But this show has already exhausted all of their resources and at this point everything looks like it was a chore to be done.I am glad Nicola aka Penelope got her story for season 3 but boy was it felt so tiring to watch her going to a ball to just end up crying every single time. The writers were just going in a cycle of dress up - ball- cry - outing - dress up - ball - cry - outing. I think 3 episodes should have been enough to wrap this whole thing up.And don't get me started on Luke aka Colin. I have never felt such second hand embarrassment for any lead like i felt for him. The wooden performance with one facial expression just shows getting physically attractive can not save an underwhelming performance. Especially beside Jonathan and the other Luke, who tend to steal the scene anytime they are in it, just like Claudia. In theory the makers are telling u Colin is now a suave sexy charming fella but on screen he came across confused little boy, reading dialogues from the teleprompter and delivering them without much conviction.I don't know why i keep torturing myself by watching these shows, this can't be even passed as a time pass. The makers have budgets, why not invest in good writers and good storytelling? Even the good actors seemed like they were in the show to play dress up only and delivered half hearted performances. My expectations for season 4 is wayyyyyyyy below 0.",

The plot and some of the scary scenes, I think, got a little bit forced just to make us jump off our seats. despite all that, 'Sebelum Iblis Menjemput' is one of so few Indonesian movies (horror movies to be precise) that I appreciate for its shots, pictures, cinematography, practical and special effect (well not all of them), the entirety of its storyline, jumpscares, and tensions which resulted from the director's bold move in incorporating some of the elements from Hollywood's best horror flicks into it (and to differentiate itself from the dull and mediocre Indonesian movies).",

    "review": "I don't usually go watch local films, but KathNiel just have that thing that makes me not want to miss it every single time (I always watch on it's first day too.) lolSo here's my non-biased review. I will try to be as objective as possible. For someone who appreciate movies a whole lot, it is such a hard thing to please me and my siblings when it comes to movies. I was a bit hesitant before watching the movie, rom-com-drama movies are not really my type. This movie, went beyond my expectations. The cinematography wasn't as great compared to their Crazy Beautiful You movie, but nonetheless, it really went beyond expectations. I never expected it to be as creative and dynamic because of the simple setting and story line, but it was unbelievably quite on par with CBY. Kudos to the team for that! Story wise, it was that kind of movie which is really simple and not as complicated as others but it really brought out the feels. I specifically loved the beginning part the most! It's not common for Filipino movies to start that way but it did! Not gonna spoil the scenes though. Gonna leave it all to you to find out how beautifully catching it was. Another thing to note, was the transition to each and every scene, the voice overs and the story flow. It's meticulously put together that you'll be hooked the whole time you're watching the movie. The dynamics was there too, will sound cliche but it was a roller coaster of feelings. When you think you're through all the heavy scenes, and can feel the whole cinema audience sharing that light feeling, they'll hit you with the feels again. To the couple, Kathryn and Daniel, they were really the one who brought the movie to life. Unlike, Barcelona: A Love Untold, we saw how great of a supporting actor Joshua is and for me, he was one of the actors who brought the movie to life. In here, it was all them. Not discrediting other actors, they all did a good job. Darren is a revelation, the kid is a multi-talented person. We can't really say anything about Miss Jean Garcia cause she really is a legend. Other cast's acting were quite bland but it was still a good one. Joross and another actor's cameo was also on point. For those who never had a relationship like me, Juan Miguel Severo and Ria Atayde was the most relatable one. They really showed what friends do, it was real, really genuine. Back to KathNiel, I really feel like this is their best movie yet. Kathryn was on her zone, she really owned this one. She literally shone her, she really showed her vulnerability and it's super far from when she was starting and her teen movies. We really saw Kathryn, not Kathryn with Daniel but Kathryn. Kathryn herself. Daniel is a natural, we all know that. I can't even explain how great of an actor he is, whenever he accepts a character, you won't see a trace of the Daniel Padilla in real life but he really gets into the character and owns it. He was the best Primo just as Kathryn was the best George. They really owned this one. Direk Cathy showed us again why she is a blockbuster director. She is a legend. Maybe not indie wise, cause that's not her forte. But we can always trust Direk Cathy to bring out all the emotions, may it be tears of both joy and pain, all the laughs and all the frustrations.Rated it 8 because there will always be room for improvement for all the actors and the movie itself, but overall it is a really great one. A must-watch!",

Plus power stations are manned so without someone monitoring operations blackouts would occur.2. How are they able to text and call each other?

How did the bus leave the city and yet the city boundaries turn into woodland?\nBut still, despite those questions I continue watching mainly for the struggle to maintain a society. It's quite interesting how leaders appear and deal with tough decisions. Plus it brings up interesting points in how law really is arbitrary; we like to assume that laws are absolute but we really agree to follow laws.I will be on the lookout for season 2!",

Picking out the poster child of Dr. Tony Bosch as the major performance drug purveyor to the A-List on a tip from a one-time Average Joe user acolyte turned whistleblower over an unpaid $4000 loan. The whole thing was at various times akin to a circus as it unfoldedl In the end it ook down not only the \"fake\" doctor but a chunk of Major League talent as it tarnished the sport. Actually the comic relief is entertaining, but the dark side is hardly addressed which isn't too surprising as that unsavory part is likely considered damage control/self-preservation of a billion-dollar industry.",

    "review": "When I saw the trailer, my impression was it was gonna be one of those movies where it's all about the hugot from start to finish regarding exes. And to someone who's seen all of Bela Padilla's recent movies, one might find that tiresome but to the casual moviegoer it's still fair game as long as it prevents us from going back to kabit-oriented movies (ah, the good old days.) If you have seen All Of You directed by Dan Villegas (same director), you might've noticed there's a lot of parallelism between both movies that's why I've decided to use my review for the latter to form my review for the former.So what is it about? It's a heavy drama movie about two 30-somethings who meet in a bar and get to know each other via browsing each other's FB profile (highlight of the movie btw.) Then we get to see how their relationship progresses, then digresses. The difference is while AOY was presented in a linear manner, EB uses flashbacks and fastforwards which may confuse some viewers initially.Who should watch it? Well, just about anyone who's been in a long-term relationship. You'll smile when you reminisce about the sweet nothings you and your partner said to each other when you started dating. You'll be stressed when you meet his ex (I mean is that an actual thing? Have you had your exes meet? If so, why? Help me understand.) You'll be worried when your first fight eventually turns to your hundredth. Then you'll ask yourself if you are staying in the relationship because you still love him or because you already invested too much of your time to it.Was it worth your time? Again, if you've already seen AOY starring Derek Ramsey and Jennelyn Mercado you can skip this one but if you haven't, go ahead and watch it. At the very least they came up with a witty title instead of basing it off of a song. If Star Cinema starts producing content for streaming, in my opinion this would've fit more nicely as a multi-part episode instead of a movie.Performances? Angelica Panganiban was great as per usual. Great comic timing, great in drama, great to look at and if anything she's the sole reason why you you'll watch. For the most part Carlo Aquino held his own, but it's undeniable he benefitted from their unequivocal chemistry. Supporting characters were well-casted, bannered by the actors chosen to play as their exes.Final Verdict? If you can't find your copy of One More Chance after having seen it for the nth time, this can give you your temporary fix. Also each song on the soundtrack is worth listening to.",

A truly savage tale, non-stop fights and attacks in prison leave Cain scarred mentally and physically but he's a MMA and survives but continuously has his sentence extended. The prison violence is the least of the horrors in this film though as hands are chopped off with an axe and a foot shot off etc. Not for the squeamish or faint of heart.

Although the story could have been a little more developed, it seems to me that it reflects in an incredible way the problem of the protagonist, we only see the world of that strange painter, his daughter is familiar to us, his problems are familiar but at the same time they are strange to us, there is something there that makes him to be him and us, the spectators, to be us, we see an exposition of a man's life, a life with problems like anyone else's but that alludes to something else, an emptiness and another problem that does not come out on camera, and this makes the film wonderful, it does not tell us the main problem of the protagonist, we feel it. It does not tell us what happens to the protagonist but in his actions, in his eyes we see it, we see what is beyond the camera, the metaphysical that torments our artist.The protagonist's performance is extremely memorable, with his eyes and expressions he manages to transmit an infinite number of things, without him the film would surely not have been so memorable.",

    "review": "Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani make for an instantly believable couple. The first moments of \"The Lovebirds\" establish that these two have obvious chemistry, they seem like a real couple (maybe even one that you know), and most importantly, they're undeniably likable. The entire success of the movie hinges upon the actors' ability to be charming and witty and enjoyable as a duo. If they do not play off each other in a fun and funny way, no viewer is going to want to hang out with them for 90 minutes.Fortunately, these two have chemistry in spades. It's their genuine connection and Michael Showalter's directing flair that keep the movie tumbling along in a semi-coherent direction despite a plot with holes large enough to fit a small yacht.In the ilk of fellow couples comedies like \"Date Night\" and \"Game Night,\" \"The Lovebirds\" takes place over the course of a single day - at least, aside from the opening scene depicting the couple fully engulfed in the early honeymoon stage of their relationship. Jump ahead four years and we see the two of them suddenly arguing about the most frivolous of hypotheticals. The one we witness happens to be about how well they would fare as contestants on The Amazing Race. It's a funny and seemingly ridiculous conversation since they certainly will not ever find themselves involved in such circumstances. But then they witness a murder, flee the scene, evade the police, and believe that they need to investigate the situation themselves to prove their innocence. From there, they are forced to follow a set of enigmatic clues leading them in a desperate dash from one destination to the next. It's their very own amazing race to avoid prison.Each scene rolls rapidly into the next and the banter crackles with just as much energy. The filmmakers hope the pacing and humor will provide enough joy that viewers will not stop laughing long enough to scrutinize the feasibility of the story. It mostly works out fine, thanks to the co-stars.By the time the ride rolls to halt, there are enough unanswered questions and jokes left untold for a sequel. If the opportunity for a second round should ultimately arise, most would happily accept. Count me in for \"The Lovebirds 2.\"",

For the majority of movie I was unable to focus on the story because of the bizarre choice to make every single shot linger for seconds too long. I felt like no editing was done between angle transitions, because it felt like so much of a buffer would happen before the next sentence was said. Otherwise, the animation was near flawless (except for the bizarre Onix at the beginning) and I enjoyed watching a great movie from my childhood remastered. I felt the same charm and emotion as I had watching the original film for the first time, and I'd still widely recommend this film to any Pokemon fans!This was a very random movie to see pop up onto Netflix, but it gives me hope that other projects can be made with the partnership of Netflix and Pokemon.",

There is a lot of eternal love around, just never getting the right people together and this keeps the show rolling. The writers have learned a bit of the novelists and a lot from the operas of the 19th Century (eternal love, switched children, revenge to the last drop pf blood, dying beauty etc.)",

Overacting and no real tears. But what can you do. With a few more coins behind the budget, this film could have really been something great. I might have gotten emotional two or three times. So, prepare for that. The movie is about a married couple who gets the greatest news and the worst news of their life on the same day. Are they on the same page? Can they make it through? Is love enough? Gotta watch and see. I gave it a six because of the lack of a dynamic female lead. And the fact that it looked like they shot a lot of it on a android phone.",

I'd much rather see more historical shows with the occasional gaffe than the modern trash we have set in the present day.It's also nice do have a mix of different languages, so do make sure you have subtitles since about 50% of it isn't in English.",

    "plot": "Since 2004, Paul Rudd has participated in a long-running gag every time he has appeared on Conan O'Brien's television programs, ostensibly to promote whatever project he is starring in at the time. But instead of a clip from that real movie or TV show, he instead always shows the same clip from the 1980s children's sci-fi adventure movie (and McDonald's advertisement) \"Mac and Me,\" in which a child's wheelchair breaks, runs out of control, and sends the kid careening over a cliff; the alien \"Mac\" pops up at the end of the clip to save him. When Rudd appeared on O'Brien's show to promote \"Living with Yourself,\" the appearance followed the same format: Rudd pretended to have brought a clip from the real show and even described which scene from \"Living with Yourself\" the clip would be from, but when it rolled it was instead, once again, the same clip from \"Mac and Me\"--with one difference: at the end, instead of one Mac popping up, the clip had been digitally altered so that two Macs appeared (a nod to \"Living with Yourself\"'s cloning theme).",
    "review": "\"Living with yourself\" is based on a rather unoriginal concept, yet comes across as super original. Make sense?So basically this guy (Paul Rudd) hates the way his life is going. He is unmotivated, uninspired, and depressed. Right when he's lost all hope, \"Miles\" is recommended by his friend to go to this weird, techy, magic, voodoo spa thing (where all hell will soon ensue).Low and behold a clone of miles is made, the exact same version of himself except well, he's better in absolutely everything, so actually, he's not the same at all.It's the most perfect execution of self vs self i've ever seen on television. Miles is in this incredible war with, well, literally himself. He's fighting for his job, his wife, his sanity, the list goes on.It's a complex idea portrayed in an incredibly simplistic manner. At times may comes across as dull or boring, but for all the right reasons. This show has a very deep underlying meaning that won't appeal to everyone. I think it's pretty damn brilliant for that reason exactly.I wouldn't say it's a show one would get emotionally invested to, character development is meh, but it is really entertaining and easy to follow.Paul Rudd is absolutely magical in this role and Aisling Bea is the perfect co-star.I'm excited to see where the show goes after this first season..!",

    "review": "I had big expectations of this movie. SF Thriller with great actors and amazing visuals, and short description sounded quite interesting. With that budget and great acting team, and strong visuals, how could it go wrong? Well, it did. Problem is it didn't go anywhere. Story, especially mystery thriller was non-existent, characters had no background and were bland and one-dimensional, so much wasted potential. I gave it 5 starts for visuals and acting but actors could do so much with bad story and bad script.Problem is, there is no mystery, at least, not explained mystery, not even searching. They opened with interesting event then just closed with open ending which, at least to me, made no sense. And I felt like I watched nice trailer or commercial, almost 2 hours long. As for SF part, there are a lot problems in scientific inconsistencies and errors and so many things that made no sense or bear no logic. So much money invested in research that was so poorly planned and was not resistant to one single error. Some things just don't happen, especially not in high profile, super-expensive missions. This movie expects us to suspend our disbelief too much.So in short, no real thriller or mystery, sf failed a lot on science part, too many illogical things, characters undefined and flat. And I was really waiting for this movie!",

Most of the side characters were seemingly uninteresting at first as well especially the mayor/princess, secretary jay, gren, doug and cain.

I was invested on Queenie since the very 1st episode and she didnt disappoint later in the series. Not a big fan of robot/ transformers-esque animation especially in this anime these transformation looks lame and very outdated and the plot was pretty generic - science experiment went wrong storyline. But kinda like it on the heavy use of the dark tone/colors throughout the anime. Some action scenes were very messy and childish. Heavy influences on chinese cultures and lifestyle. Great opening and ending songs - giving me a very 2010s pop rock vibe. The ending was rushed (like all animes out there). Cheesy on the use of the 'family article'.

I had a lot of issues with that film but this version manages to be even worse than the original.The Girl on the Train follows Mira Kapoor, a divorced lawyer struggling with alcoholism who takes the train and looks at a couple's life through the window. One day she notices something shocking leading her down a dark path.I may dislike the 2016 film but this version makes that film look like a masterpiece. I don't even know where to start with this trainwreck of a film. First of all, I hated the structure of this film. I didn't like the structure of the 2016 either but at least it gave some depth to the characters and maintained a dark tone throughout. The narrative here is so messy. Characters are barely developed here and the changes made by Ribhu Dasgupta were totally unnecessary. The addition of new characters and subplots were poorly executed. There were so many sequences down to the smallest of details which made no sense. There is a scene where Parineeti Chopra is talking at a support group in Hindi which makes no sense as there were people from other nationalities around her so how would they understand what she's saying. Even the way phones are used looks so fake. If you're familiar with the GUI interface of WhatsApp then you'll know how fake the interface looks in the film. It requires less effort to use the real one so why waste time creating a fake one? It's details like these that really annoy me.The actors really did not stand a chance with how bad the script is. Parineeti Chopra tries but ultimately fails. Emily Blunt brought a level of subtlety to the role which made it look realistic. Chopra ends up being too dramatic and borderline cartoonish. Aditi Rao Hydari is wasted due to the lack of development to her character and the same can be said about all the male roles. Kirti Kulhari is also underutilised. The script is filled with awfully written dialogues that take away from the seriousness and is unintentionally laughable. Like the 2016 film, this film is also very dull and has a lack of suspense which is sad considering this is meant to be a thriller.Ribhu Dasgupta's The Girl on the Train is an absolute mess. There is so much wrong with this film that I'm actually struggling to think of any positives. It's filled with poorly developed characters, plot points that make no sense and contains no thrills. Was it necessary to remake this story in India? I don't know but all I can say is this film is a complete failure.",

One of them comes to the conclusion that they are in a situation similar to 'that movie with the hacksaw' and that it was 'crap', you may recognize this actor from the film Jigsaw, and unfortunately for his character, Ron, its kinda true... The other guy, played by Don Sutherland, is Judge Straight, a title, not like Judge Reinhold. :) And finally, the kidnapper. His name is Henry and he has an ax to grind with the judicial system, and he's a wiz with that whole internet thing the kids are talking about these days, so he decides to hold Judge Straight accountable for a case he presided over in which a man was convicted and put to death for the kidnapping and murder of a 14 year old girl, a case Henry feels the man was wrongly convicted, and broadcast it on the internet and the public gets to vote guilty or not guilty. Is there a twist, of course there is! And its a pretty sweet one, tho perhaps predictable. Its not going to win any awards for best acting, Vincent Kartheiser was cool as Henry, and I was satisfied with its conclusion. A film that also makes you say, well, he has a point...

    "review": "Omgg it's been awhile since I watched such a good drama. I just finished watching it and I already want to rewatch it. This literally blew me away with just everything and omgg the emotions are so high with this drama.Plot: I really dislike watching dramas where its just the same cycles over and over again of the main leads breaking up and getting back together constantly (like for example, every other episode), so I was super happy with what the writers for this show did with this drama because we none of that (yay!). There was so much creativity into writing this and there are SOOO many good plot twists. The plot is far from boring and invokes so many emotions. There are both really funny parts and really sad parts ANND those REALLY CUTE romantic scenes that most everyone lives for. The plot brings together fantasy elements and romance elements with a hint of wuxia here and there. ALSO the ending was everything you would ever want esp since nowadays so many drama endings are the absolute worst. This drama does a good job of closing out all (or most but I couldn't tell if they missed any) of the plot holes and tying everything together.Characters: I was really happy with the character development in this drama. The changes in each character are so subtle yet if you compare two eps far apart from each other, you can tell the difference in most of the important characters eg.jinmi. They did such a good job of revealing the backstories, intentions, etc. of characters as well in a way that would be either 1. wow I didn't see this coming or 2. i wanna cry. I LOVED the way that JM and XF fell in love and gradually realized what they meant to each other. Also, some people have mentioned in the comments that they don't really like the amount of screen-time that the demon princess gets, but personally I kinda liked the storyline between her and MC as well as their characters, but that might just be me :P The demon princess (LY) is kind of that loyal badass sidekick character with a soft side and sometimes you can't help but cheer her on. Also shoutout to Moon Immortal character cuz he just made me laugh every time even if he was being serious. Of course, each character has those times when they're being annoying (esp the villainous/evil characters) but overall none of them stood out as being terribly written and I can say that I was even happy with how the evil characters were.Costumes: Might seem weird to mention this but I just really enjoyed seeing how each realm had their own distinct style and how each were shown so beautifully. Little things like hairstyle, accessories, makeup, clothing composition, etc really add to the drama in a good way. (Example: bird realm's clothing (Sui He) compared to flower realm's clothing (JM/ Chief Zhang))Acting: I haven't watched that many dramas with YZ in it and I didn't expect too much going into it but wow her acting was so great and the way she portrayed various emotions was crazy. The way she could make you want to cry is insanely amazing and her chemistry with DL is really really good. DL's acting is also really good, as expected, and the way he portrays pain and heartbreak is incredible. Aside from those two, I don't really have any complaints with any of the other actors/actresses. They all did a great job :)Music: warning- the music is so perfectly inserted that you wanna cry like every time there's a sad moment LOL. No complaints with the music---I think all of the selections fit the drama really well.Animations/CGI/Production: As with every fantasy drama especially, a lot of animating and cgi needs to go into the production since the setting includes places like Heaven, Hell, and various other \"realms\". The realms were all animated so well, and while there are TOMPB vibes going on (esp. the flower realm and the heaven realm), it stands distinctly on its own beautifully. The colors are amazing and I love the clouds loll xD The cgi just gives it the right magical feeling. Another commenter mentioned this as well, but the dream beast that stayed by RY's side throughout the drama was animated so well. You could see all the details and the colors and everything was just so real.My Favorite Part: mini spoiler but I absolutely loved the part when JM and XF went to the mortal realm and lived like mortals for their \"redemption\" trial. Free from their immortal responsibilities and burdens, their characters were just so pure and raw. It made me laugh, smile a ridiculous amount, and bawl. When dramas bring out every type of emotion there is, you know it's a good drama.",

    "review": "Well, this Netflix produced Indonesian movie was something of a mixed stew of genres, with elements of comedy, horror and drama thrown into the melting pot. But it actually worked out well enough, truth be told.I was familiar with the movie's existence, but haven't gotten around to watching it before 2 years after it was released. There have been so many other movies piled up on the to-watch-list. But finally got around to watching \"Suzzanna: Buried Alive\" (aka \"Suzzanna: Bernapas dalam Kubur\") from directors Rocky Soraya and Anggy Umbara.Turns out that \"Suzzanna: Buried Alive\" was actually rather enjoyable. Now, I am not overly familiar with Indonesian superstition, so I am not an expert on how their ghost lore is. But hey, the movie was entertaining nonetheless.The comedy in the movie was good, but not to the point where you are bursting out laughing and having tears trickling down the cheeks. But it was a nice combination with the classic horror for Asian cinema in terms of a ghost story.I have to say that the storyline was actually quite good, and it was well-written by writers Ferry Lesmana, Bene Dion Rajagukguk and Sunil Soraya. I was quite enjoying the pacing of the movie and the events that transpired on the screen.Now, with me not being overly familiar with the Indonesian cinema, I must say that it was nice to watch a heap of new faces on the screen. Yeah, I have a thing with watching actors and actresses that I am not overly familiar with on the screen, as they are not associated with previously portrayed characters in other movies.\"Suzzanna: Buried Alive\" was actually an enjoyable movie, and if you enjoy a light-hearted Asian horror comedy, then you should take the time to sit down and watch this. I am rating it a six out of ten stars.",

His wife & family is stranded north of the border, whilst with little really skill he is able to rise rapidly to the top of the food chain in the drugs world.The truth is that they had an initial germ that could have developed into something, but seemed to have taken a lazy root. Maybe the series was too long, and they could have simply had a better story if it was much shorter. The lead playing Yankee to me was very unconvincing. Never convinced me he was some streetwise capo in the brutal drug world in Mexico. If anything, he was weak to me, and counter to his mirror psychopath in the show, it made little sense he survived.The lady who played Yankee's wife in particular was terrible, and in some ways her character on-screen was treated in an almost creepy & leery way for just the sex scenes etc. She was also a bad actress, the way her story played out was really total nonsense. If anything, it made little sense.However, the one character who really does stand out for me was the undercover Laura Wolf who was a brilliant interesting character and was very well played by Ana Layevska who I will keep an eye out for in the future. If anything, her story was the main crux of the show for me, and I'd argue the only thing that will keep you watching.Sadly, overall the show was poor. It's clear why there's no follow up season. Sad note, that one of the lead actors died prematurely not long after the show aired, Sebastian Ferrat. He was actually decent albeit over-the-top. RIP.",

I get so annoyed with so many of the dramas when the main actress acts helpless or dumb (when they try to act 'innocent'). The main actor is so cute and funny! I absolutely love the scenes when he's jealous of guys being around Qing Qing. The actress that's super awful to Qing Qing drives me nuts (means the actress did an excellent job!).\nThe only downside of the show I see is the writing. The acting is perfect but I find the story writing can be messy at times or filler. Overall I really hope there's a second season!",

From the first few minutes of episode 1, I could already tell most of what would happen the rest of the season, its almost as if I were there while they were filming lol... HOWEVER, I actually enjoyed it a lot. It was very refreshing and very different from Netflix's new releases. It was wholesome, the setting was great along with the fashion as well. The kid actors are really good and I loved the relationship between the three ladies. I'm really hoping it gets renewed for a second season.If you've seen one Hallmark/Lifetime movie, you'll probably be able to predict almost every scene lol but if you're like me and don't really care about that and are just looking for something refreshing and relaxing, then this is the show for you!Only con with this show (well not only but major con, the others I can let go of) is, while it gives me a lot of Gilmore Girls vibes(which I actually do love), most of the actors are like walking inspirational quotes and sometimes, I just want to yell at them to speak to each other like normal human beings.

    "review": "\"Little Switzerland\" is located in Teller\u00eda, a fictional Castillian village but located in Basque Country tries become part of Switzerland after a surprising discovery. They find in the town's sanctuary, information that makes its inhabitants apply for membership in Switzerland. Discovering a medieval sepulcher, it seems to be the tomb of Walter Tell, son of legendary Swiss hero William Tell. Finding an ancient documents that prove the creation of Teller\u00eda (Tellstadt in English and rest of languages) as a gift given to Walter Tell after his help to the King of Castile Alfonso XI in a battle . But the government denies that request . While Gorka (Jon Plazaola) , in love with his co-worker, Yolanda (Maggie Civantos), but she has a Portuguese boyfriend and in the middle is Nathalie (Ingrid Garc\u00eda Jonsson), a city council official and Gorka's friend since she was a child . Love and trouble over territorial identity are the bases for this comedy.This enticing comedy contains emotion , humor , amusement and lots of jokes and laughs . This is a bemusing film that contains comical sketches , tongue-in-check , grotesque incidents , but above all , it especially packs humor and irony ; concerning interesting issues as the competition between the Spanish autonomous communities, the abandonment of the towns by the authorities, the governmental selfishness, and the Basque idiosyncrasy itself. The main premise is the following one : our protagonists get mixed up in all kinds of absurd , hilarious and even romantic incidents when a fictitious little town, Telleria , which wants to belong to the Basque Country and after Switzerland, resulting to be the best scenes : the publicity spot of the town to introduce us to Switzerland. In Spanish comedy, a subgenre is being born based on cultural confrontation as the center of humor. Basques, Galicians, Andalusians enter the gags of this trend that includes films such as \"Ocho apellidos vascos\" (Spanish Affair) and \"Perdiendo el norte\" (Off course) . Sometimes, the political reality of a country collaborates with the scriptwriters when it comes to creating movies and here the hilarious situations happen between Basques and Castilians , causing laughter enough . The difference between one idiosyncrasy and another is usually exploited to tell light and absurd stories, where making fun of the other is paramount . The film moves in fits and starts most of which would be desirable, with more traps the viewer resists any kind , and moments of enjoyment and others quite a few embarrassing . This enjoyable Spanish comedy has humor , nice players , entertaining situations and lots of fun .The script isn't right, it's quite flat, but the ensemble cast ends up saving the film. However , the picture attempts to spread optimism about the events of life , culture differences and love , including its amusing sides . The roles in this film are all lovable despite being rather pathetic and silly. And here standing out a large number of notorious secondaries gving notable and sympathetic acting , such as: Ram\u00f3n Barea , Secun de la Rosa , Antonio Resines , Anabela Teixeira, Maribel Salas and Kandido Uranga-Enrique Vill\u00e9n , both of whom provide the best comical moments. And of course the indispensable and always likable Karra Elejalde.Kepa Rojo's direction is a bit sloppy, though acceptable, since he puts too many subplots on the board that make the main story confusing, but he also manages to make the protagonists constantly find themselves in trouble and that causes laughter in the viewer. This was his second sucessful film , the first was the unknown : El s\u00edndrome de Svensson . It fulfills its objective of making people laugh out loud, as long as the viewer does not think a little further. Rating : 6.5/10 . Worthwhile watching . You don't take any risks, but that's okay movie , it is not intended to deceive anyone. \"Little Switzerland\" is a comfortable comedy, with a continuous joke about geographical identity, which sometimes shortcomings on the repetitive side. The flick will appeal to Spanish comedy fans.",

    "review": "I'm just going to rate this documentary for the story it tells about Bob Lazar's life from the moment he came out with the alien story until thirty years later. Other reviewers gave some very negative ratings whilst I don't think that was justified. If a story about Bob Lazar is told by Bob Lazar himself I find that interesting rather than boring. Before even watching a documentary about aliens eveybody already has an opinion wether they believe or not that there is extraterrestrial life. So if you're believer you will believe everything Bob Lazar tells, and if you're a non-believer you will think he's a scam. Personally I'm a believer, as I once experienced an UFO sighting for myself, so there is no doubt in my mind that there is life out there. That governments would keep this information secret, especially the USA, is absolutely normal as the whole economy of that country relies on fossil resources and weapons. Remove wars and oil from the American economy and the whole system crashes. So of course they won't tell you about a spaceship that doesn't need fuel as that would destroy their own system. The documentary is far from perfect though. The narrator Mickey Rourke is unpleasant to listen to, but luckily he doesn't have a major part in this documentary. The film maker is also a bit boring to watch so that's a second bad thing about this documentary. But the explanations and interviews with Bob Lazar are very interesting and even for someone who doesn't understand that matter it's still explained so that everyone could understand. Bob Lazar as the alien whistle blower, deserves respect, just for telling the truth and that after being harassed and watched for his entire life. The fact that his house has been raided by every possible agency tells enough about him telling the truth. They wouldn't do all that fuzz for a liar. Just leave the guy alone and tell the world the truth.",

Psycho borrows inspiration heavily from many, many western films. And in many ways, Mysskin has created a clone of those crime thrillers that you so love in Hollywood.All the acting was meh. Nobody's acting particularly stood out. Nithya Menon was the best among the bunch, along with Rajkumar Pitchumani (the psycho), who delivered what was expected of a role like this. Udhayanidhi Stalin was pretty okay, not really dwelling deep into his character.With the onslaught of crime thrillers in recent times, i really expected this to stand out.",

He shows him how to greet the mountain and dispense offerings, and relates legends of a village of the dead beyond mysterious boulders. Kanto is nonplussed by all this, but when Debo shows him a bear cub he has been secretly raising, and asks Kanto to help, the boy comes alive. What Debo doesn't tell Kanto is the reason why he is raising this bear cub. When Kanto discovers the truth, it sets the two generations of Ainu at loggerheads.Ainu Mosir is a film to immerse yourself in and experience. It manages to showcase Ainu music, customs and culture without sentimentalizing them. Writer-director Fukunaga casts Ainu non-actors and achieves a process whereby the story and performances feel rooted in authentic concerns and experiences. Debo Akibe as Debo is a brooding presence, a man as much in conflict with his identity as the young teenager he takes under his wing. His wish to resurrect a dormant custom, one which may put the community in collision with wider Japanese and global society, provides a focus for wider contemplation of the plight - and it is a plight - of indigenous people everywhere. The Ainu, a proud people long constrained and confined by another culture, suffering a slow death, perhaps need to find traditional if brutal symbolism to express their plight. That may be my personal reading of the fate Debo has in mind for the bear. One of the many joys of this film is that it offers up many readings.The compact 84-minute running time reveals deft storytelling skills as Fukunaga takes time to show music and dance, feasting and sorrow, and make social commentary as tourists compliment their fellow Japanese Ainu on being good at Japanese, But none of this distracts from Kanto's journey of awakening, as his mother, Debo, musical pals and even the bear cub, offer up a gaze onto his journey that invites him, and us, to question who he is and where he is headed.Ainu Mosir is a beautiful, lyrical film, and a confident sophomore outing for Fukunaga. One suspects that representations of Ainu in Japanese cinema will be measured against this film for many years to come.",

    "review": "Now I would not call the movie surprising in any way or especially grand. It still is able to entertain the viewer with 4 powerful main characters in the mix who are all looking for their father. This may not be the most interesting premise for some, but it is what we are dealt with here.And it works to a degree (foreseeable events and all), if you allow yourself to be intrigued by it all. Now I understand that for some this seems annoying and boring. That is fair, but it should never make you question the actresses involved and even more so spanish cinema overall. This tells you what it is, so you are never cheated in anything",

Playing a role of gentleman, he seemed little off in few of the scenes, may be intentionally or may be unintentionally, for that reason he gets 9 out of 10.This is my first time watching Athiya Shetty in any movie, she is the heart of this movie. She seems very natural actor, that she proves it in this movie. Once you see her in this movie, it will seem that this role was written for her, you will not be able to imagine any other known actress playing this role better than her, she gets 10 out of 10. This movie will create lot more bigger fan base for her, that too among the movie makers.And last, this movie has great music and perfectly placed songs. All songs runs in background, pay attention to songs and its lyrics, chances are that you will be re running each one of them on YouTube afterwards.Go watch this refreshing movie, you will appreciate it that you did.",

    "review": "#FinalVerdictBypass Road had the potential to be an exciting fare but first-time director Naman Nitin Mukesh fails to inject that edge-of-the-seat excitement, making it a long and tedious affair.An interesting thought may not necessarily translate into an interesting screenplay. Bypass Road is a prime example of this statement. It is akin to a bottle of soda, which starts off with zest but the fizz settles down faster than expected. Bypass Road is loosely scripted & full of inconsistencies. It may have an interesting premise as its starting point, but the writer (Neil Nitin Mukesh) fails to flesh out a foolproof screenplay and doesn't even stay true to the film's own absurd logic. The film had great potential to be a riveting thriller but halfway through, you realize that the writer & director (Naman Nitin Mukesh) have run out of ideas. Bypass Road is one jigsaw puzzle that remains unsolved even after its culmination. Come to think of it, your imagination can run wild with a premise like the one in Bypass Road. But it runs out of fuel midway. In a nutshell, Bypass Road promises the moon, but what you eventually get in return is merely a mirage. A damp squib!Specifically, the screenplay (Neil Nitin Mukesh) should've packed some great moments, but the writer seems to take an easy way out. The story is a chaotic mess & for no reason, it takes a non-linear route complicating even the simplest of things. Director Naman Nitin Mukesh has an eye for visuals but he couldn't do much since he's saddled with a poor script. The cinematography (Fasahat Khan), too, neither heightens the drama nor does it add any thrill. Music is the sole saving grace.Neil Nitin Mukesh showed great promise as an actor and you only expect him to climb the ladder in his next releases. Adah Sharma is alright. Gul Panag & Shama Sikander add to the glamour quotient. Sudhanshu Pandey, Rajit Kapur, Taher Shabbir & Manish Chaudhari enact their parts with confidence but they have nothing substantial to portray.To sum up, Bypass Road is a huge let-down. An apt case of body beautiful, minus soul! Flop!",

    "plot": "George Sphrantzes was the Emperor Constantine XI's personal secretary and a friend. According to his own account of the conquest of Constantinople, his daughter Thamar (named Therma in the series) was 12 years old when the city fell and was taken into captivity by the Turks, dying in the Sultan's harem in September 1455 of an infectious disease. Therefore, the series inaccurately portrays her as having escaped to the island of Chios, which was then controlled by Genoa. There is also no evidence that Thamar and Giovanni Giustiniani Longo, the leader of the Genoese mercenaries, were in a romantic relationship.Contemporary accounts do report, on the other hand, that the mortally-wounded Giustiniani was carried off to a Genoese galley which then headed for Chios. Giustiniani died either en route or shortly after arriving on the island and was buried in the Church of San Domenico (later the Church of Santa Maria del Castello, which eventually was converted into a mosque following the Turkish conquest of the island in 1566). The tomb is now lost.",
    "review": "As a a Greek, I could have been pre-emptively negative about this series.\nHowever, I cannot ignore the fact that the producers did some serious research and consultation before they put pen to paper.\nFrom the small conversations to the serious arguments, it appears that they have checked first with the historians.There is good acting, good atmosphere, good costumes, decent battle scenes and loved the fact that the producers were careful with not allowing the documentary bit to take over.The only three things that stopped me from giving it a 10/10 are that\n-) The utter obsession with Justinian to the point the whole series is about him and how heroic the Italians were.\n-) The obsession with portraying all Greeks as treacherous cowards (you couldn't help yourselves there :)\n-) Portraying the Turks as inferior and Mehmed a hotheaded and recklessI strongly recommend and can't wait for the sequel (probably about Vienna)",

My best pitch for it is basically, 'Based on a Stephen King novel that Stephen King never wrote'. And that was sort of the vibe I was going into it with after my previous film, which WAS a Stephen King adaptation, 1922 (2017). I was in sort of that King zone of just really loving his writing and how he just burrows under the skin of his characters, and this really to me is very much inspired by King, it's inspired by The Twilight Zone (1959)... Ordinary people caught in extraordinary situations. That's stuff I really like exploring.\"",
    "review": "Unfortunately not very good as a movie. These Netflix originals are really hit or miss stuff and I think I can see a pattern already. In many cases they are something that would work better as an episode of an anthology series and don't really benefit from movie length. There simply isn't enough substance to carry a full movie.We have a mother and a child who for whatever reason are moving by car and decide to take a short cut through a small desert road. Tyre goes flat and a rattlesnake bites the kid while the mother is changing the tyre. Mysteriously a trailer appears nearby where they go to seek help (cell phone naturally does not work). Kid is cured, but the cure comes with a price that puts the mother in a difficult situation. While kind of interesting setup, there is zero beef to the story, nothing is explained or based on anything. And this is often the case with these \"direct-to-Netflix\" movies, things just happen. When there is no story to base the plot on, it's not very interesting. Just so many why's .. And the ending is fittingly unsatisfying.The direction - while not exactly bad - definitely does not add any artistic value to the movie. A movie either needs to be artistically interesting or tell a proper story, this one did neither. Why a rattlesnake? Who was the lady? What was the movie all about? Is there some folklore about a rattlesnake bite and cure that I as a European don't know? I mean the movie is even titled \"Rattlesnake\" and not \"The Curse of The Desert Lady\", which it probably would have been called had it been made in the 50s. It kind of has the same b-movie quality to it.The acting is ranging from ok (Ejogo) to bad (Rossi).",

    "review": "This series is an intriguing attempt to find the sublime in the ridiculous. What we have to remember is that Pacific Rim was, by design, frivolous and almost a self-parody. It was a knowing wink at the ludicrousness of kaiju and the fancruft that have grown around them, with \"no alloys\" and \"50 diesel engines per muscle strand\" as standout lines signalling that everyone involved was revelling in subverting and almost-but-not-quite mocking the source material.The Black plays it all far more seriously, trying to show the consequences for squishy humanity of the \"kaijufication\" of earth - or more specifically, Australia, but best not to dwell on that detail, given that most of the voice talent are resolutely North American. There's loss and tragedy, there are merely elephantine kaiju-hounds to give a human sized threat, there's genetic experimentation, there are Jaegers that aren't quite Jaegers: all sorts of ideas that are well worn tropes in themselves, but fresh to this milieu.The animation is entirely CGI, there's not a hand-drawn cell to be seen. It's very well done though, at least for the human characters. Surprisingly, it's not so great for the kaiju and Jaegers, which are fairly generic grey-and-blue vs grey-and-red over-shadowed blobs, with little sense of size or mass to them.What really shines through is that the lead voice acting is outstanding, and for once they're given half decent lines to deliver and they're not phoning it in. Gideon Adlon does a compelling turn as Haley, bringing an appealing warmth, range, depth and emotion to the role. Erica Lindbeck also plays it pitch perfect as a passive-aggressivly sardonic training AI, introducing just the right amount of levity. Calum Worthy is the straight-man, and given a bit less to work with, but he takes a damn good swing at what he's given. This is highlighted by contrast with the cast extras, who turn in fairly generic anime performances.The pacing is also a strong point, with decent story arcs and few flat spots. You won't find much Japanimation budget-stretching scenes here of composed of 2 minute still frames with trembling eyes and meaningless ejaculations of \"Oh! Ah!\". It's all dialogue here, lads. The score and foley are also well done, adding to rather than distracting from the animation and voice talent.I'll be honest, I was ready to dislike this, but it won me over. It's a bold and well realized series with its own strong vision, and it delivers it competently and confidently. Definitely worth a try.",

The miniseries most importantly would have been better off without the badly explained sciences fantasy elements (why is The Force in this?) but the overall picture is better than its assorted elements and the anime works well enough as a one and done pulp adventure. The music is what I will remember the most and a lot of the animation is well done for a TV production.

Also love the background art, really good!Dub: I watched it in Filipino and English. I actually prefer the English not because they were acted better, since I feel like both were done quite nicely but because when the Filipino chants come up it feels more special and magical and also the English dub did different variations of Filipino accents which I find fun.Plot and delivery: I read the comics first so can't help but compare. I wasn't expecting like a 1-1 adaptation but anyway...I'm 50 50 on the changes. I like how the stories and characters are interconnected now compared to it being episodic in the comics but I kind of miss the emotional impact it left me, learning the different motivations of people, why they did what they did etc..so watching this just feels... a bit shallow and fast but the things they added do give it some good flavor so this or that, can't have both in this case.I'm also really into \"Show don't tell\", there was a lot of showing in the very first episode which might be a bit too much backstory flash but I much prefer it to that cliche villain doing 15 minutes of monologue just to explain their motivations and background while the protag just listens obediently which this show is also guilty of. :(Overall: Giving it a 7. Good start but the end episode... that I am not really into it went cliche as cliche, the comics was done way better. For me overall, it lost a bit of that soul since a lot of the scenes they cut to connect the stories also carried a lot of the emotion, badassery, and smarts so I was a bit disappointed with that. I'd still wait to watch season 2 if ever as the story they're going to cover there really made me feel the tension while I was reading it so a bit excited to see what they'll do with it if we ever get to season 2, lol. Anyway, it's just okay I'd still recommend it.",

    "review": "This film is an extraordinary achievement. With footage going back over the years, the directors have pieced together the saga of the establishment of a Chinese-run industrial operation in Dayton on the site of a much-lamented closed GM plant, illustrating, with total objectivity, the contradictions that ensue from the imposition of one national worldview upon another in a dynamic that it never a clash of equals. The impatience and contempt of the Chinese investors toward their U.S. workforce and the consequent cultural conflicts are highlighted to devastating effect, illustrated by what American viewers will find to be an uncomfortable dissection of their own culture, in all its fatuous self-indulgence, by amazing footage of lectures on the subject by Chinese cross-cultural consultants as they lecture Chinese workers and supervisors sent to Dayton to show Americans in how things should be done.At the Q&A at the premiere at IFC Center, co-director Julia Reichert was at pains to stress that the film was never meant to be polemical, that this was an effort to immerse and learn. While some of the silllier aspects of both cultures, (but especially the regimented and self-congratulatory aspects of the Chinese). come through with particular acuity, you can't help buy muse on how Americans have acted with equal tin-earedness and cultural arrogance around the world, over many more decades than the Chinese have been at this game.At the same time, America's neediness of manufacturing jobs, even if they don't pay a living wage, and the ways that so many of what we would normally consider our core values go out the window to accommodate anyone who will invest in them, come through particularly clearly. This all comes together in a fight over the establishment of a union that would protect workers' rights and uphold our eroding safety and environmental standards that is the vivid core of the movie.A final note: This film has an extraordinarily compelling musical score by someone names Chad Cannon that propels and highlights the narrative and is amazingly effective on its own terms. Although the idiom is different, Cannon's score does for this film much of what Philip Glass's have done over the years for the films of Errol Morris, and that is high praise indeed.",

    "review": "This is coming from having seen both the Swedish Wallander (Krister Henriksson) series (which is the best) and the UK Wallander (Kenneth Brannagh) series (which is also very good), and watched only one of the Swedish movies with Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd (as the others are hard to come by).First, Young Wallander is set in current day, which is the first thing which already is a problem.\nGoing into it expecting a real prequel set at the end of the 60's or early 70's and seeing a brand spanking new volvo already gave me a WTF, then seeing a mobile phone made me really think WTF is this.... Ok, then I just adjusted my expectations, but it surely was not what I expect from a 'Young Wallander'. I think they did it to keep the costs down, as a period piece is much more expensive, and with in mind if it's successful they can still go on for many years and still keeping the costs down.Second, even though the actor looks great, his voice is really annoying, as he sounds like he has an astma problem or out of breath every single time he opens his mouth. Krister, Kenneth and even Rolf never sounded so hoarse. And the other problem is what's point three...Third, English. Even though Kenneth Brannagh's version was completely in english, it wasn't really a problem, but in this version it's clear Adam P\u00e5lsson is not a native english speaker and it shows, it's the second thing about this actor which makes it not so great to watch him play, he has a very thick accent while the rest of the cast hasn't.. They should have just cast an english actor or done the whole series in original swedish (latter would have been my preference). Now it really annoyes the hell with the actor AND speaking hoarse AND having a bad accent.I think it might be based on the book in which it has 5 stories about his youth, but if it is, it just wasn't really translated well by the creators of this series.. It is clear Henning Mankell wasn't involved himself in this series like he was in the previous incarnations.\nFor a 6 parter I think it just dragged on too much, this story could have fit much better as a 1 hour and 30 minutes episode like the Henriksson and Brannagh series had done.\nI'm still gonna watch any new season as I'm just a sucker for detectives, but I still think it's a shame they botched this a bit by the miscast of this actor (pure based on his voice/accent, not his acting itself).",

    "review": "Born Beautiful is Cignal Entertainment's first offering for the year and if there's no saying yet that 'If you can't start you year right, at least start it beautiful' then there should be one and you can start your year beautifully with this movie.The sequel to the wildly successful 'Die Beautiful' was originally to be a 12-part TV series to be aired on Cignal's platform but instead was made into a full-length film which follows Trisha's sidekick Barbs (filled in nicely by Martin Del Rosario) as she tries to make sense of her life after going through the deaths of two of her friends and whether the life she's living is the right one for her. Joining her in her journey are Lou Veloso as the effervescent Mama Flora, Kiko Matos and Akihiro Blanco as Barbs' lovers and Chai Fonacier as the \"wildcard.\"Born Beautiful tackles the controversies of undergoing conversion therapy (a law was passed just hours ago banning them in NY) and polyamorous relationships (it's not for everyone but it works for others), which is brilliant considering gays, most notably transgenders have been told over the years that they are unlovable and the only way they can be loved is if money is involved. This movie is telling us that that's not the only way and they don't have to settle. At this time when it's easy to spread hate (fake news, bullying, etc.,) why not love as many as you can (in varying forms and degrees) for how can you go wrong with love?As with the first installment, this one also elicited reactions from people who were obviously uncomfortable with some of the scenes, most notably the kissing between two male actors. This in turn made me feel uncomfortable which reinforces the stigma that LGBT shouldn't publicly display their affection, that only straight people are allowed to do that. That we should censor ourselves so as not to offend others in order to be accepted by society at large. That way, the old one, reinforces the need to be \"acceptable\" at our expense. What this movie does is it pushes us back out into the light, telling us not to hide anymore. If the first movie's theme was asking for acceptance, this time around we're taking it, that we're here, we're queer and we will not live in fear because not everyone will die beautiful, but everyone was born beautiful and deserves to live beautiful.",

The human Pilots are reverting back to their destructive alien self and they need a thingamajig from alienaplace to fix the thingamabob.I am utterly surprised that this franchise seems to be going full bore. The original is not the worst start to a franchise but it is undoubtedly a B-movie. Its bigger world construction has issues. For an one-off movie, a lot of that can be overlooked. As the sequel shows, the franchise intends on building on that construction. This is the third movie in the series and it seems to be doubling down with a healthy budget. Quite frankly, it may serve the franchise to pull back to do a smaller story. Going to another planet is not a smaller story. It's a hard thing to pull off and the third act is a mess. The movie is split into two locations and neither is that compelling. The trailer park could be a good small B-movie but this one insists on doubling up. All of that is to find a stupid looking egg. It makes the movie look stupid.",

    "review": "This is the first time I will be writing review of a web-series as it has provoked me to write about the terrible incident. Delhi Crime was an eye-opener of the famous Nirbhaya case which is intriguing and disturbing.Based on the horrific incident of 2012 Delhi gang-rape of a 23 year old girl in a moving bus, which rocked the entire nation, Delhi Crime is the chronical of the detailed investigation carried out by Delhi Police and the effort spent in nabbing the 6 accused involved in the crime within 5 days.Directed, researched (for 4 years) and created by Richie Mehta along with Laurence Bowen and Toby Bruce, Delhi Crime is one of most dark and disturbing movie I have ever seen. The seven episode series will keep you hooked to the detailed investigations starting from a wake-up call at 2 AM to the DCP of South District, Delhi Police, Vartika Chaturvedi, informing about the bleeding and naked victims, lying along streets during a cold-wintry night of Delhi, police officers travelling across the remote areas of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jharkhand to locate the accused till the confession made by Nirbhaya herself. Each and every scene has executed appropriately and accurately.Delhi Crime has been told from the Delhi Police's point of view - how their lives got impacted along with their family during those 5 days of strenuous investigation, working endlessly at the police station and not even being allowed to go back home. The web-series details out the struggles and challenges faced by the cops mentally, physically and financially (yes ... there were budget constraint even during this critical time). Few scenes do stand out - the interrogation scene between Delhi Police and remorseless Jai Singh, who was proud of his misdeed, the scene where a police call-operator wants to leave early but is always held by the DCP, the hospital scene where the doctor tells DCP about the deteriorating condition of Nirbhaya and the scene where the judge finally comes directly to record the confession of Nirbhaya. Hats off to the director for making it bold and blunt. Delhi crime was also an eye-opener for the story on the male victim, who was being sympathized by many till now. As rightly pointed out by a police officer, he could have fought against attackers in the moving bus. The web-series also shows his willingness to be in limelight by giving interviews to media, despite being warned by the DPS twice that it might spoil their investigation. Unfortunately, the media in our country is one piece of crap who would go to any extent to sell their stuff without even understanding the grimness of the situation.Delhi Crime boast off some strong technical support. I should start with an outstanding editing work. The background score is haunting and yet mesmerizing. The cinematography is brilliant, portraying a real-life crime with aplomb. Screenplay is fantastic, though it becomes little sluggish towards the 5th and 6th episode.Coming to the performances, it is Shefali Shah who will make you believe in the tough investigation carried out by the Delhi Police. Inspired by real-life IPS officer, Chhaya Sharma (former DCP South District, Delhi Police), Shefali Shah lives and breathes the character of Vartika Chaturvedi. Shefali is complimented by Rajesh Tailang (Mirzapur fame), her long-time co-worker, who stands tall with her at each and every moment. The actors playing the role police officers on field were equally marvelous.On the whole, Delhi Crime is not easy watch but it will expose the harsh reality of what happened on that fateful night and it will definitely make you angry. Go for it ...MIND-BLOWING 4.5/5",

    "review": "I was looking forward for this show and so far, I'm enjoying it.\nBefore anything, for all people out there saying \"the actress doesn't look like Selena, her hair doesn't look like Selena's\" .. just do a little research and you'll find out that Selena actually had pretty curly hair and in her earlier years she did rock her curls! Only later she started to style her hair in a different way. You'll see that her hair curls and color actually looked like that before... Later on in the show you'll see she changes her style as she matures and becomes a woman!\nI am, like many people, a huge fan of the movie with JLo, but obviously they speeded up in order to make a 2 hours movie about her life, the series portrays a more detailed and slower paced timeline. So they actually did a great job by showing her hair like that. Just give it some time because the series is showing her earlier years and the process of her becoming the Selena we know.\nYes, there are some negative aspects, but I think that it's overall consistent and well portrayed. Sometimes the acting isn't the best performance, but it isn't THAT bad either.\nObviously the actress can't dance as JLo, hasn't the same curves as JLo , but she's good and as far as I know, Selena's family chose and approved her to play Selena... That has to mean something. Just enjoy the series for what it is. Don't compare to the movie. It's a different kind of magic and it's great that her memory is being honored.",

The series explore alot of different African countries and the inner cities, fashion, music and actors all in one season. Good start for an African series.

Overall could have been a better movie if there was better set design and production values. The special effects and props so are reminiscent of the 1990s that u will feel a dash of nostalgia . The story could have been better as the element of unpredictability is missing. The film falls flat in its script, plays more like family drama in space.

About 2.5 hours of footage divided into 250 segments was shot for the episode, with over a trillion unique permutations of the story (though many of those will be very similar).

    "review": "I gave it a 10 even though I'm aware that it's not a perfect movie, because of the lesson it has taught me personally. This movie introduced me to some things I might encounter in my future after I graduate. It somehow scares me, but it also prepares me just in case i experience the same.As an idealistic person myself who dreams so big, just like Cristine in the movie, I appreciate how this film shows how life can mess up with you, and how you can mess up yourself. It follows a story of what-if's that were not answered in the past, and how sometimes you might get twisted about that past and the present.It teaches us that we can dream, but not be so idealistic that we think everything will be perfect. When life hits you, you will realize how important it is to know what the present holds and brings, and to not give that much pressure on yourself about the future.Alone/Together is not a just about romance, I actually refuse to see it as a romance movie; it did not just focus on the love story but also and especially the challenges, the lessons, and the growth of the main character.",

    "review": "A rather unique Japanese movie based on the theme of gambling at a school academy of for elite students. The movie immediately follows up on the television series of the same name (currently available on Netflix). Surprisingly focusing less on the sexual proclivities of students of this age group, the movie elicits a strong emotional and compelling storyline about the intrigue and deception that occurs at this exclusive school. Yumeko Jabami arrives as a transfer student and eventually plays a key role accepting invitations to gamble challenges. This mystery, drama thriller often entertains with its brash but at the same time subtle, nuanced performances and dialogue steeped in the obscure Japanese culture and tradition. Even though some of the actual gambling outcomes seem more manipulative and artificially created for dramatic effect rather than realistic strategic gambling technique, there is always the surprising twists that occur throughout the movie. Dazzling in set design and both the outrageous and deliberately underperformed acting, this movie captures a different vib worth experiencing. For English viewers, there appear to be at least two versions of English subtitles, one pretty bad and another sufficiently decent that greatly impacts the level of enjoyment that can be derived.

    "review": "I have taught English language and literature for over 40 years. One thing that has always challenged my students is the concept of \"magical realism.\" With \"The Man Without Gravity,\" I have a tool that makes teaching this genre (perhaps??) easier and FUN to do.I happened onto this by pure accident, but from the opening sequence, I was immediately struck by how this film echoes of M\u00e1rquez's story, \"A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings.\" Yes--the conceit is similar: a man can \"fly.\" But both reveal deep concerns about \"normalcy\" and how we are afraid of things that are outside the narrow and \"prestige\" defined range.What works in this film? First, the plot is magical: we see an infant born float from his mother's birth canal toward the ceiling attached to \"earth\" only through the intact umbilical cord. That image was compelling. But we move forward to where this boy meets and falls in love with a girl. Circumstances separate them, but they are reunited for a happy ending. OK--I'm a sucker for this plot device, but the way we are led through it is compelling.The acting is lots of fun. The two leads: Elio Germano (Oscar, the protagonist) and Silvia D'Amico (Agata, his love) are fun to watch and we pull for them as children and as adults. They have an innocence in their faces which I relish and which compels my empathy and joy for them.The directing is OK, too. This film could easily have gone overboard, but it depends on simple SFX that work and also maintains the focus on the two central characters. Marco Bonfanti-who also contributed to the story-manages the pace and images to keep engaged with our characters. One quick reference: see the scene where Oscar and Agata are running thru the umbrella shrouded streets. It is a joyous sequence.Lastly, I refer once more to the magical realism. Tho' I am aware of some films that have attempted this concept, I believe this one carries it off extremely successfully. We are invited into a world where we accept that marvelous things can happen. And ultimately, the marvel is young love growing into mature and lasting love.Take an hour and a half and relish this movie. Some who discard it, perhaps, don't realize how magical realism is an important 20th century genre and that this film does a great job of showing us the magic and the realism of love.",

    "review": "To be honest, Chief Daddy was really disappointing. Star studded but yet not much you can lay hold of. I think the directing should bear most of the fault from this train wreck alongside the incoherent writing. The cinematography also, as there were moments when an unneccessary camera shake dented the believability of the scene even more than the forced humour.\nOn the good side, Falz did quite well with the role he was given. The end credits song was quite hilarious. To the producers, please this should mark the end of this destinationless franchise.",

Around half the movie is in Africa and that's fun to watch. The movie has an interesting screenplay that has a scope for a fine movie, if not a great one.\nWhat did not work:\nScreenplay was okay and the movie started fine. It went downwards afterwards. The narrative gets corrupted and mingled in between making it messier and unattractive. I think the movie could have been a better watch if the execution was done better. The editing and action sequences in Africa were not well choreographed. The movie had mediocre acting, an average plot execution making it a superficial project wanting to be smart and intelligent. The movie is not without plotholes.\nFinal verdict: it's an okay movie about something familiar in an unfamiliar settings",

    "review": "Kerry's depiction of a mother worries for her missing son is highly believable. The fact that she, who is black, is met by a young police officer, who is white, and that they have to grapple with their individual reactions to each other i.e. inexperience and all too common micro aggressions on his part and a different lived experience and suspicion on her part made for uncomfortable but riveting scenes. Also loved the scene between her and the more seasoned cop which, besides displaying an overuse of force by a black officer, also delivered some difficult truths.I love that there were so many layers to the plot besides the scenes between the mother and the police officers. The film also succeeds in showing the aftermath of a marriage that has completely broken down and just how far people can drift from those first blissful moments in a relationship. Anyone whose ever been through a bitter break-up will surely recognize the truths in these scenes.The transition from Broadway to television was, in my opinion, extremely well done. The focus was squarely on the four performers which is where it should be and not on a whole lot of Hollywood-type frills. Makes me wish I had seen the original play.",

    "review": "Netflix suggested that movie and even in the trailer I thought that looks promising. Little did I know that this would be an overachiever. It is cleverer than the usual coming of age and finding yourself stories.The power lies in the writing and in the direction. I don't wanna knock the cast they are all fine but they are not the strength of the movie. It is the writing with a very clear constructed story with very well established themes and a well formed character arc for our protagonist that is also reflected in the supporting cast. This is not about sexual orientation it is about finding your true self in life and standing for what you are. It is about the sacrifices and work that you put in the relationships with the people you care about.Good writing and very well constructed scenes make this movie easy to watch, and to live vicariously through these characters. To remember what it was like when you were at that odd place in live where everything is \"messy\".",

Raquel moves to the town with her husband, who is a local, to take up the teaching position. She didn't know that her predecessor, Viruca, had died in a presumed suicide. The more she learns the more Raquel starts to think Virura may have been murdered, possibly by somebody in her class. As the series progresses we see Raquel's story intertwined with flashbacks of the events leading to Viruca's death.This is a somewhat mixed series; on the down side one does have to suspend one's disbelief at times... watching the series one would think there was only one class at the school and the way the students and teachers interact seems highly unlikely; it is far too casual and students get away with threatening teachers. If you can get passed those problems the central mystery is gripping and there were plenty of genuinely tense moments. As the series progresses more suspects emerge as we learn about various activities going on in the town which include affairs, sexual jealousy, shady financial dealings and drugs. The cast is solid; most noticeably Inma Cuesta and B\u00e1rbara Lennie as Raquel and Viruca. Overall I'd recommend this despite its problems; if you want a good mystery it is definitely worth watching.These comments are based on watching the Series in Spanish with English subtitles.",

In it, two high school friends find themselves transported from our world into the magical world of Ni no Kuni.Admittedly, this is kind of a basic fantasy story structure in sort of a basic fantasy land, but it is a well handled film. Everything about this is generally fun. I rather liked the mechanics of the connections between our world and Ni no Kuni. The dynamic between and motivations behind the two leads are strong. I particularly liked Yuu, the wheelchair-bound one who is brave, intelligent, and cool headed.If you're familiar, the first Ni no Kuni game included animation from Studio Ghibli. In fact, the director Yoshiyuki Momose was animator for the studio. Now, this doesn't have quite the level of detail of Ghibli or the games, but it still all looks pretty nice.Be forewarned that there is a moment with an adult character talking about a seventeen year-old's attractiveness that gets uncomfortable.

Jump to 2020/2021 in cartoon land, or \"animated series\" and we have to make do with seasons consisting of 6 episodes each. Let's be honest here, these are basically expended commercials for the (admittedly wonderful) new WFC toy line. Going into Siege I was expected there would be a lot of action and story packed into the episodes, considering 6x24 minutes isn't a lot to work with time-wise. I was wrong. Characters seem half asleep, nothing much happens, even when Siege transitions into Earthrise. During both current seasons my kids asked me when the Transformers would stop talking (slooooooowly, so full of pretentious \"meaning\") and would actually transform. But no, the al forms are almost never seen, they're just robots, talking, depressingly talking, and running. It struck me that Bumblebee thinks it's a better idea to run away from a big threat in Earthrise rather than transform into a car and drive like hell. Then we see Sky Lynx and its alt form is never even shown. To make matters worse is that the voice acting seems to be done by actual robots; there's no emotion or any life in any of the dialogue. It's tiresome and weak. Even the blast effects during fighting are a miss; \"plip plip\" sounds without any oomph. It's just a boring show for adults that has no real feeling of stakes, doesn't reward investment, and offers no hook beyond seeing the original transformers combined in a few bare bones episodes, but they're not in disguise, and we hardly see them in action.",

As far as I know the story is fictional, but it is presented as if it actually happened. It is the story of a young businessman who becomes very rich very quickly through fraud and deception and then very quickly loses everything again. It is reminiscent of The Wolf of Wall Street, without Betonrausch ever reaching the quality of the Hollywood blockbuster.But nevertheless a very affordable German film. Germany is not known for their jokes and humor, but the understated light comic style works well for this film. Characters are explored just enough and the film never gets boring. And furthermore, all the glam from The Wolf of Wall Street is represented: fast cars, expensive tailor-made suits, large villas, wild parties and the necessary drugs. It is beautifully portrayed, with a good soundtrack. The acting is okay.For fans of The Wolf of Wall Street quite a recommended film on Netflix. So a well deserved 7.",

Luke Goss, though, is a quality actor, who rose above the muck he was given to turn in a really good performance.The biggest downfall of the film, besides Randy Couture's to-be-expected woeful acting, and the absolutely atrocious 'acting' performances of everyone else in the entire movie not mentioned already, was the script. It was beyond terrible.One example - a completely unnecessary and ham-fisted attempt to divulge backstory, in an attempt to force the audience to care about a barmaid, delivered by a terrible actress, was so bad it, just, stayed bad. Not one piece of dialogue seemed to fit, and when you give bad dialogue to bad actors, it's not going to turn out well. One of the worst scripts I've seen filmed.The setup for a sequel was obvious. White and Goss could definitely make a really good movie together, and these characters themselves would be fine. But a better director and an actual script would really help next time.",

Personally not a big fan of episodic stories and prefer something that is actually going somewhere. Yes there were flashbacks and plenty of them (ugh) but they were often just conveying the relationship between the characters, with a small amount explaining certain circumstances of how they got to where they are.\nThere was also an issue with pauses, something new to me and hope I don't experience it again. Couple of characters would be having a conversation and then when one asks a question there's this sudden long pause. It's like someone paused the show and god is it irritating, that being said much of the dialogue I found was drivel.\nAlso there doesn't seem to be much on character development. You get the many flashbacks of how they came to where they are but going forward or some sort of goal just seems to be lacking. Heck I'm pretty sure there wasn't an objective unless I missed it.So yeah, the premise get a pass but the lack of story and actual character development kill it, which is a shame because it looked promising.Overall I would recommend it to people I hate.P.S.

    "review": "As evident from the majority of the reviews here, this film presents incredible and unique animation-- and a story line that will confound the best. It is beyond me why an entire production team would create a film that absolutely no one in the audience is going to understand. This is a very self-absorbed non-story that builds up all kinds of suspense and mystery, with zero delivery. That's not a spoiler; that is the essence of what (at this time) is stated in every viewer review.There are so many strings left hanging here, with \"clues\" that go nowhere. Where did the boys come from? What part did the girl play? What did the computer data have to do with anything? What actually happened... at any time during the film? None of these questions are answered nor even close to answered. Perhaps the writer and director thought they knew what story they were telling, but one would have to be psychic to understand it. When a director stumps the entire audience... he's failed to understand the difference between art and absurdity.I understand that art doesn't necessarily require a story, but it is so much better when it does. This movie is so \"Zen\" even a Buddhist Monk would be scratching his head. At least we don't see the typical, \"I got it and you didn't nya nya\" type of reviews... because everyone has had the honesty to admit, \"I didn't understand a thing that happened here\". Kudos at least to the reviewers who admit that this one is WAAAY over the audiences head.Or maybe the director and animators had way too much weed easily available. Who knows? It was an interesting roller coaster ride, but in the end one can't help but wonder if the car actually moved.",

Consisting different elements such as Drama, Emotions, Crime, Thriller. This blend has always worked pretty damn good for him. And it happens once again!The storyline here follows a similar pattern to his previous films, It is amassed with twists and turns. It beautifully portrays Relationships and their values. The emotional punch wasn't as strong as I usually expect from him but still it was on point. It just never hit the right strings each and everytime. The thrill element has being kept decently enough. Specifically in the second half where the plot transitions into more darker & serious tonality. But still it has some illogical points and loopholes that can't be ignored so easily if you think deep. The performances honestly levelled up all the final outcomes though. Their commitments for each character has shown integrity and seriousness towards the plot and I admire that. Aditya Roy Kapoor, Anil Kapoor have done their roles amazingly. Kunal Khemu was a surprise package. Sad to see His talent so unutilised in the industry. He is so underrated. Disha Patani has certainly improvised on her acting skills here. Great to see her giving dedicated efforts to do so. Eli Avram was decent too in her short tenured role.\nOverall the performances made the plotline convincing and genuinely Helped it to become much more engrossing and tenseful.The music and the soundscore as a whole played another major part; regarding the vibe of the movie. It showcases some soulful songs that fits so well with the innovative Cinematography. The music will stay in your mind for very long time, I can assure that!Overall it's a nice movie, that didn't disappoint me nor did satisfy me to the fullest. It's good for what it is. And it will vastly depend on your judgement or whatever your preference is. Personally I enjoyed it and I think you would too.",

    "plot": "This is the second time Park Min-young and Kim Mi-kyung are playing mother and daughter. The first time was on Sungkyunkwan Scandal (2010).",
    "review": "I've always said that if you aren't willing to at least risk being tacky, you won't have any fun.That's one of the themes of this show. The opening line is: \"All Children Are Artists.\" As we see when the group later goes to an orphanage, the children take pure joy in expressing & sharing of themselves. They aren't worried about critics or reviews.This show introduces us to Duk-mi. She's an energetic, hard working & passionate person who lives in Technicolor. A once aspiring artist, Duk-mi is now the curator of a privately owned museum. Her job is not ideal as she, along with her suggestions, are rarely respected. Duk-mi is not easily suppressed, though. She does her job with verve. She also has a secret life away from the museum. If found out, she would be fired. You see, Duk-mi ...\ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41... Is a \"fan\ud83d\ude0dgirl.\" {GASP!} Pop singer Si-an is the recipient of her affection, and she is not alone.Fangirls are a sisterhood of women, ALL devoted to a star. Besides knowing ALL the music and ALL the useless trivia about their idol, to be a true fangirl, one must be at ALL the star's public appearances. This includes ALL airport arrivals and book signings, not just concerts. ALL this dedication is neither easy nor cheap. We watch Duk-mi go from the museum, straight to a Si-an appearance lugging a step ladder & 14 inches of zoom lens. From behind a black mask, she snaps her photos & heads home, where we see how deeply her obsession is etched onto her being. Her studio apt is a giant Si-an collage. It's jammed with every souvenir of which one could conceive - posters, dolls, the requisite cardboard cutout & even Si-an pillows... Even a water bottle, half full, that Si-an threw to the crowd once. (I said 'half full' out of habit. This water bottle is definitely half-empty!). It's basically the tackiest decorating ever - Even worse than Bette Mildler's in Ruthless People.We then meet Ryan (Conventional. Condescending. Cheerless). He's an artist turned lauded NYC critic. A mental block has severed him from his craft. He can dip a brush \ud83c\udfa8, but he can't touch it to the canvas. As a critic he isn't known to look at many pieces for more than 3 seconds (<1 sec is typical, 2+ could launch a new artist). He stopped creating art when a painting of soap bubbles arrested his gaze. Believing it was Stendhal Syndrome ('When exposed to an incredible work of art, one may experience a rush of psychological symptoms.') he sees a psychiatrist. His therapy was going the way of his paint brushes, though: Nowhere. It's a mystery in the NYC art scene, as is the artist, Lee Sol, who brushed on those bubbles that popped Ryan's career. Nobody seems to know anything about the painter.The first time Duk-mi and Ryan meet is at an art auction in Shanghai. They fight over a painting. The painting is of soap bubbles. Artist: Lee Sol.Duk-mi knows that \"her SI-AN\" is a fan of Lee Sol's work. Every year, The Road To Si-an webpage pools money from fans to buy a big gift for the object of their adoration. Her boss thinks it's merely a work trip, but Duk-mi's real mission is to get that \ud83d\uddbc for Si-an. She loses. She tries to talk Ryan into surrendering the painting to her. He looks at her like she's a lunatic. Fate is at work; these 2 have 2 other chance meetings, though they both don't put it all together until later.Duk-mi's boss, the director/owner of the museum, is a garrish, overweening tyrant. She is played by the great Kim Sun-young, who's clearly having the time of her life in the role & in those preposterous outfits. She makes Duk-mi miserable. Fortunately, her husband is embroiled in a scandal, so she must step down temporarily.You get one guess as to who the next director is.They don't blend well.That should adequately lay out the paints on the \ud83c\udfa8: Except for their overlapping love of art, Duk-mi & Ryan, a Korean adopted overseas, have opposite existences. They are compared & contrasted in visual ways. Dude's home is painted a deep Wedgwood blue. While it's a pretty color, when it covers 4 walls it only reflects his current bleakness. Taste aside, Duk-mi's room is vibrant. She's open, which is why she can feel art so intuitively. She's full of love and passion. Ryan is dried up like old paint.Ryan becomes drawn-in by hearing Duk-mi talk about works of art. With admiring fondness, she seems to be able to scry an artist's thoughts & emotions. He becomes fascinated with her w/o realizing it or thinking about why. Fascination leads to close observation. (\ud83d\ude31! Don't look behind the mask!) We can feel doom approaching. What will Ryan, who is from that snotty NYC art world, think if he ever discovers HPL?Another theme is family & togetherness. Duk-mi's parents created a home where all are welcomed. Duk-mi's mother is, well, /motherly/. She wants to feed and love-on everybody that comes through their door. They even raised Eun-gi - from birth - for an overwhelmed single mother. He & Duk-mi consider themselves siblings. Fellow fangirl, Seon-joo, who runs the local coffee shop, is Thelma to Duk-mi's Louise. The office, Duk-mi's apt, the museum, the coffee shop, and her parents place are all frequent gathering spots. Duk-mi's life is shared with family, and friends-that-are-family.Ryan's life is solitude. That's why he's angry when Duk-mi pokes around his place when he's not there. He seems to have no one.The two seem to fall for eachother quickly, though it takes them a few eps to realize it. While the falling-in-love is usually the funnest thing in a romance, in the case of Duk-mi & Ryan, I found the series even more entertaining after they get together. The way they mix it up is sensational; their relationship is pure enjoyment. Duk-mi smiles with her whole being. She smiles a lot. At first it seemed overdone, but it's rather by design. She is the SUN that warms him back up. Art is all about light. Ryan couldn't step forward until he came out of the darkness. His first steps towards healing were in Duk-mi's direction.There are mysteries to be solved, secrets to be revealed, and singers to love in the balance of the show.HPL also sketched in some laughs. They have trouble with R-r-ryan's name, so they call him \"Lion\". Eun-gi tells Da-ni that she'd be an annoying friend. She looks at him and says: \"You're a good judge of character.\" We understand Duk-mi's obsessive side when we get a full look at her family home: It's genetic. The two protags are in a chess game over a notebook and the truth about Duk-mi, which is amusing. Generating laughter could be the trickiest art of all, and HPL sells it.Poor Eun-gi. He's coming in 2nd again. He wins the silver medal (again) in scoring his gf. Duk-mi was just a primer, actually. He certainly has a type! In my ledger, Eun-gi's gf won: Eun-gi is arguably more attractive, & he's protective, loyal, appreciative, chill, great to hang out with, and... Well, did you /see/ that shower scene?? That actor probably has fangirls himself. Nuff of that...While HPL is certainly silly, and completely adorable, romance-wise, it can also be profound. The following exchange is a free therapy session: Seon-joo's TV producer husband is pushed into doing an 'expose' show on 'crazy' fans. He hides this from Seon-joo, and even secretly copies files from her computer. When she finds out, she could have foamed up milk with no machine. She was STEAMED. He tries to explain, with the most positive framing, all the good reasons why he made the show, including securing the transfer she had wanted him to get. Fangirl nails it. She might be silly, but she ain't dumb. She asks if it was all for /her/ sake then? He says no, he didn't \"mean that...\" She responds:\"Do you know what I really hate about you right now? If you've hurt me, you should just remain as the assailant. Why are you using me as an excuse to act like a victim? Do you expect me to understand and pity you in this situation?\"He replies that he shouldn't have waited to tell her, and he's not sure why he stalled with that. She comes back at him again:\"Do you want to know why you didn't tell me beforehand? It's because you didn't feel the need to. You knew I'd throw a fit later on, but you were simply going to escape that moment.\" In finishing, she informs him that he didn't talk to her because he was already determined to do it.One of the excuses he used was that it was all for their son. Her response: \"You used my precious family as a weapon to stab me, and {your son} as a shield to hide behind. It was a nasty and cowardly move.\"Perhaps that exchange will be useful for your next relationship argument. She later says that 'in a relationship there are things that cannot be resolved with logic. This is a matter of emotion.' Well put.There are disappointments: No big \"reveal\" to Si-an, we don't see the expos\u00e9 show & leaving a child at the playground?! C'mon. They could have done plenty of things better, but the positives redeem it. It's good enough to hang in your gallery.The most important takeaway from HPL is that a loving and caring family unit can do a lot of good. Duk-mi and her mother make numerous lives better. Duk-mi's mother gets the credit as she raised Duk-mi. We ran the \"open house\" in our neighborhood. We are close with many of the kids still, and we even Christmas with two of the brothers that were fixtures in our home for a few years. We can't go after everything we want AND love others. The two are exclusionary. The odd thing is that helping others is more fulfilling than going after everything we want.Quote: In Korea, if you kiss and don't go out, they send you to jail.\ud83e\udd17",

    "review": "\"Kate & Leopold\" is not a top quality film, but has some seriously funny and entertaining moments. Most of those were delivered from Breckin Meyer, who plays Kate's brother. For example, the part when he keeps talking in the background and nobody is listening to him.  I also enjoyed when he said \"we have a saying in our household 'shake and bake the chicken'\" or something of that sort.The best part of this movie by far is Hugh Jackman. Not only is he devastatingly dashing and handsome, but his performance shows off his acting chops quite well.  However, he and Meg Ryan had little on screen chemistry.If you like silly romantic comedies, or if you just like Hugh Jackman, I would advise you to check out this film.  You also shouldn't expect much plot wise.  The script lacks continuity and has a few plot holes and many inconceivable ideas (well, so do most films, but others do a better job of making you believe it).**1/2",

    "review": "\"Tunisian Victory\" is a film that seems much more like a documentary than the usual propaganda pictures being made in America at the time. What I mean by this is that the documentary tells the story of the Allied victory in North Africa in a very straight forward manner...with little of the usual jingoism and hyperbole. Because of this, it's aged very well.The story is of Operation Acrobat. It begins in November, 1942 when combined American, British and Free French forces invades Northwest Africa in Morocco and soon heading to Algeria and Tunisia. The story is told using lots of high quality footage taken of the battle as well as diagrams and narration as well as actors providing some of the narration in the guise of soldiers.The bottom line is that for 1944, I cannot imagine a better war documentary and it's quite a bit better than many of the other similar documentaries of the day. Well made, interesting and a treat for history lovers.",

    "review": "Omar Sharif (\"Ahmed\") returns to his Egyptian village to try and help the local agrarian population improve their lot. This does not suit the local Pasha (Zaki Rustum) and so he sets about sabotaging their ambitions to grow and harvest their own crop of sugar cane. What follows is a hybrid love story/crime thriller as the Pasha's daughter - the gorgeous Faten Hamamah returns home after 8 years and begins to rekindle the feelings she had as a child for the hero; whilst becoming embroiled in an ever deepening crisis that only increases as a local Sheikh, who has assumed who was responsible for the destruction of the crop, is slain. It is easy to see why Sharif was snapped up by Hollywood - he is a very good looking man who oozes charisma, and there is a certain natural quality in the scenes he plays - especially with Hamamah. The ending let's it down a bit - I felt that the story sort of ran out of steam, but great onsite photography and a pacily directed (by Youssef Chahine) small cast make this well worth watching.",

It contrasts with Dino Risi's other 1955 film, K\u00e4rlek, br\u00f6d och tusen kyssar (1955), in the sense, that it is isn't a movie about charm, but rather on the absence of it and on jealousy.Nevertheless, the directing of Dino Risi attenuates the film's dramatic themes.

    "plot": "According to Rosemary Clooney, the \"midnight snack\" scene in which Bob Wallace expounds on his theory of what foods cause what dreams was almost entirely improvised.",
    "review": "By 1954 the song White Christmas had become such a timeless classic that it was inevitable that a film would be made around it. And of course the star would be none other than Bing Crosby. But who to star with him.Originally this was to be the third Irving Berlin outing for Bing and Fred Astaire. Then Donald O'Connor was to co-star, but finally Danny Kaye teamed with Der Bingle. Proved to be a felicitous combination.By then Rosemary Clooney had worked in a few films well and more importantly, she had clicked with Crosby on the radio. Bing had teamed with several girl singers over the years, like Connee Boswell, Frances Langford, Mary Martin, Trudy Erwin, Carole Richards, Peggy Lee and a trio of sisters named Andrews. But he always said Rosemary Clooney was it for him and besides Mary Martin, the only other one who did became a leading lady for him.It's not remembered because of the success of her solo career, but Rosemary Clooney started as a duo with her sister Betty who retired early to raise a family. So with Vera-Ellen as her sister in the movie, that was an aspect of the plot Rosemary could handle with ease.The plot such as it is involves Bing and Danny as a song and dance duo who've expanded into the production end of show business. Through a little bit of a con game worked by Vera Ellen, the two meet a singing sister act like the Clooney sisters were. The sisters turn out to be headed to Vermont to work at a resort and the smitten guys go along with them.Problem is there ain't any snow there. It's an unheard of 68 degrees Fahrenheit in early December. And the place is owned by Crosby and Kaye's former commander from World War II, played by Dean Jagger. He's about to lose his shirt and his pride. So our intrepid quartet go to work.Irving Berlin's score for White Christmas is about half new songs and the other half from previous scores. That's how it was when you got Irving to work for you. Listen carefully even to the background music. You will not hear one note of a non-Berlin song. One of those songs was a personal favorite of mine, Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep. I recall in grade school in Brooklyn it was a song that the teachers had us sing in the school assemblies. Little did I know that it was introduced by the guy who proved to be my favorite entertainer. It's a patented philosophical Bing Crosby song that he did best and it serves as a ballad to woo and win Rosie. Bing sings it and then Rosie joins him in the reprise.Danny Kaye has two good numbers. The first The Best Things Happen While Your Dancing is clearly originally for Fred Astaire, though Kaye and Vera Ellen make a lovely couple on the dance floor. The Choreography number I think was also done for Astaire, but here dancer John Brascia does the complicated dance routine while Kaye sings. I'm sure Astaire would have handled both jobs had the film been made with him.All the stars do the Minstrel Show/Mandy number, but Vera Ellen really shines in it. She was a great dancer, really sparkled in every film she did.Besides Sisters, Rosemary Clooney has a grand torch ballad that sold a few platters for her in Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me. She had a wonderful singing voice and the most impeccable diction of any female singer ever. You don't miss one throbbing word on any of her ballads.White Christmas was Paramount's first film done in their wide screen process called VistaVision. And of course it was proper that their number one star for over 20 years be in this film. Of course jokes about Bing's derri\u00e8re and the wide screen got into the repertoire of a certain comedian named Hope.Just like the song that inspired it, White Christmas has proved to be a timeless holiday classic and will remain so.",

    "review": "\"East of Eden\" and \"Giant\" are both great, don't get me wrong.  But this is the James Dean that set the archetype for not only the cool Fifties American teenager but perhaps every teenager since.  Dean has his white t-shirt, sleeve rolled up for his smokes.  He has his red jacket and blue jeans, he's ready to drag and he's ready to fight.  From the first moment we see Dean, drunk on a school night, busted by the cops, he's amazingly both personally secretive and universally accessible at once.  He's hurt, lonely and looking for kicks - and no one understands him except, maybe, just maybe, that one person in the audience...Sure, this movie has it's faults.  The parents are cartoonish, some of the kids are hip in only a stilted sense and a lot of the movie is unrealistic.  There's something disturbingly hokey and amateurish in this portrayal of a typical American town with it's typical American high school. Yet, Dean, Mineo and Wood put on performances that let the viewer suspend reality all the way through..each of these three put on the performance of their lives!Sal Mineo plays a mousey misfit named Plato (whose homosexuality is thinly veiled).  Natalie Wood plays a young women named Judy, part of the in-crowd, who deep down is at wit's end.  Both of these characters are amazingly believable, even fifty years later.  Mineo's never been as enigmatic or as compelling as he is here as Plato.  Then there's Wood - as cynical and alone in her world as Judy feels, we realize quickly she likes James Dean, she needs James Dean - and Dean can dig her.In retrospect, it's not surprising that the jacketed juvenile delinquent that Dean plays here would become a role model for both young gay men and young straight men alike. He's comfortable being intimate with Plato, his words, his expressions are all too much, too overly emotional (for a straight man).  But, the kids, the town itself, quickly learn Dean's no pushover.  He yells, he fights and he's afraid of nothing that other people are afraid of - staring down death is just a way for him to kill time. But, he's afraid, something just isn't right with his life. And most importantly, even if he never really does connect with this \"typical town\" filled with \"typical people\", Dean does indeed connect - to anyone whose ever been young - and alone.....",

Not doing her job screwed the rest of us but her made up work was the sort that shallow solutions could make her and our boss look good. And he was a clue less boss. So seeing this actress with her grotesque facial expressions, lording around like queen of the station with her grimy face in the varying lights of Cairo Station was hard to take. Not really fair to the film.There are no heroes in this movie and it was fine. Everyone was trying to survive in the station in their own roles.

When the screenplay deviated wildly from the stage text over Tennessee Williams's objections, Newman expressed his disappointment.",
    "review": "The best thing Cat on a Hot Tin Roof has going for it is one truly remarkable acting performance. And that performance comes from neither Elizabeth Taylor nor Paul Newman. There's nothing wrong with the work turned in by Taylor and Newman, they are both perfectly fine in their roles. And it is their characters who are the focus for most of the film. But late on in the proceedings Burl Ives grabs hold of the film and makes it his own. Ives turns in a performance which is so strong and powerful that it threatens to overshadow and overwhelm everything else in the film. However it is rather difficult to overshadow Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman. And the film's rather simple story is certainly compelling enough so as not to be overwhelmed by the Ives tour de force near the end. So while Ives may end up being the most memorable thing the film has to offer he is certainly not the only memorable thing. His great performance is merely the best part of what is an overall thoroughly satisfying film.The film's simple story centers around a day in the life of a wealthy Southern family. With this family the key word is \"mendacity\". What does that even mean? Any of our characters who initially don't know about mendacity surely will by the time the story plays itself out. As we meet them everyone has come together to celebrate the 65th birthday of family patriarch Big Daddy. Initially it seems the film is about Big Daddy's son Brick and his wife Maggie the Cat. Brick and Maggie are not currently in the throes of wedded bliss. To say their relationship is strained would be putting it mildly. The fact that alcohol seems to be the only thing in life Brick is at all interested in probably does not help matters. But as the film progresses we see there is a larger issue than Brick and Maggie's troubled marriage. Big Daddy is dying. And nobody, not his family and not his doctors, has the guts to tell him. This will ultimately play itself out in powerful, heartrending fashion.For much of the film's running time you would call it compelling but certainly not spectacular. But then Ives, as Big Daddy, grabs the film by its throat and shakes some real life into it. There's a scene where Ives as Big Daddy and Newman as Brick are alone in a basement which simply could not have been performed any better. There's so much these characters have to say to one another. The emotion is raw and the scene is so powerful. It hits you right in the heart. Just this one scene alone, with these two great actors, elevates the film all by itself. Newman is terrific. Ives is astounding. Perhaps it is in fact possible to overshadow Elizabeth Taylor. Maybe just this once. Maggie the Cat is an intriguing character in her own right and Taylor certainly doesn't disappoint in the role. But it turns out that ultimately the film is really about the relationship between Brick and his father, not Brick and his wife. And as such it is Newman, and most especially Ives, who you will most remember. It is their work which transforms a good movie into something truly memorable.",

She celebrated the deals and compromises within a sexist order that allowed a lucky few high-class prostitutes to become well-to-do, independent women in fin-de-siecle Paris (and a lot of others to at least make some kind of living). She empowered women, at a time when there just weren't many other opportunities for them to establish real independence (our current categories of PC and non-PC wouldn't have meant much then). It wasn't always pretty, but there was reality in her writing about relations between the sexes that hasn't lost its relevance. Of course, this had to be soft-pedalled for the American audience - hence the ending, which conforms nicely with middle-class morality on this side of the Atlantic. This is the only \"politically\" unsatisfactory thing about the movie, however. And it remains superior - both \"politically\" and as a film - to My Fair Lady, where Eliza is implied to return and submit herself to Rex Harrison at the end, whereas Gigi at least implies that it's Gaston rather than Gigi who is going to have to change his ways.My only other gripe: Why no dancing from Leslie - and from Vincente Minelli, that peerless director of dance sequences? I guess Lerner and Lowe must have been more in control of this one, and weren't of a mind for rug-cutting. Too bad - there really isn't nearly enough of Leslie dancing on film as it is!",

I tend to prefer earlier films, both from Raj Kapoor specifically and from Bollywood in general -- from the sixties on they get too westernized for my taste, and the dacoit setting here places the story squarely in Indian territory. I also liked Padmini's spunky energy, and her repeated exclamation \"Hoi hoi hoi!\" (whatever that means, I'd like to know,) it really got stuck in my head!",

    "review": "I'm happy to credit film historian and broadcaster Karina Longworth's most recent podcast series on the lives and careers of Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. For pointing me at this and other Rat Pack-era movies starring some or all of the members of that particular clan.This was the first feature to highlight in one film the three most prominent leaders of the Pack, so to speak, of Sinatra, Martin and Davis, as well as the more peripheral figures Peter Lawford, Joey Bishop and even Shirley MacLaine in a brief cameo. Unsurprisingly, considering the affinity most if not all of them had for the place, the action here centres on Las Vegas where Sinatra as Danny Ocean acts as the leader of his old ex-army company brought together by heist fixer and financier Akim Tamiroff to carry out, in one night, the major heist of five famous Vegas casinos, netting them all a cool million dollars in the process.For many, the Rat Pack was that era's epitome of male cool but look closer today and like me, you might instead now see in the movie a bunch of middle-aged men mistreating their wives, patronising lower-level black employees and casually slapping the behind of a young woman who's just given a private massage to another of the Pack. The worst moment is when Davis himself is made the butt of a quite literally off-colour remark by his so-called buddies. Sure they all look smart in their natty suits and skinny ties as they man-bond and deliver a stream of acerbic one-liners but boorish behaviour, even by superstars, is still boorish behaviour and there's no way to condone such actions even when perpetrated with an accompanying song or smirk by Frankie and Dino.Parking that, with some reservations, to one side, the film has a great premise, the simultaneous, meticulously-planned takedown of the casinos but unfortunately it takes an age to get going, with over an hour wasted for the sake of only the mildest of plot exposition or character development. Martin and Davis each get to sing a song or two along the way, although oddly enough not Sinatra, but I found myself just hurrying the movie along to the sting itself.I loved the shots of old-time Vegas and the cool closing shot of the eleven walking out of picture as the famous real-life billboard of the Rat Pack comes into view behind them, but watching it, I felt the movie could have been sharper and snappier. I doubt it was an easy gig for veteran Lewis Milestone to keep his starry cast concentrating on their jobs and felt that sense of underlying indolence, which is counter to the precision required in the operation, worked against the movie's effectiveness.I've heard somewhere that one definition of cool is to not seem as if you're trying but here it's taken too literally with the overall effect that the movie just lacked a spark to really jump-start it into life.And ain't that a kick in the head...",

He feels he cannot climb the 400 foot precipice atop which the German batteries sit, but he likes nothing better than \"a well-organized setup\" upon seeing that he has no choice.  With the help of his closest combat comrade Stavro (Anthony Quinn), Mallory is assigned with Major Roy Franklin to ferry British commandos - one of the a wise-cracking explosives expert, Corporal John Anthony Miller (David Niven)- on the perilous journey to the back door of Navarone.  But the infiltration is fraught with danger, and when Franklin is badly injured, the real crest of the story unfolds, the moral dilemmas of the team as they must complete the mission while deciding how to handle an injury they cannot treat.  And as if that were not enough, one of the Greek resistance operatives helping the team turns out to be a traitor after Miller finds his explosive equipment has been tampered with.  It leads to yet another of the several arguments that ensue through the film between Miller, the soldier who does not want the responsibilities involved, and Mallory, who is determined to finish the job.  While one of the arguments doesn't make much sense - Miller is horrified when Mallory admits lying to Roy Franklin so that upon eventual capture Franklin will give away inaccurate information; this is by far the most humane solution to the intolerable dilemma the team has faced - overall the clash between Mallory and Miller adds enormously to the film's tension, thanks in no small part to the excellent performances of Gregory Peck and David Niven.The sets and props of the film are superb, and overcome the comparative cheesiness of some of the special effects.",

    "review": "I think Stanley Kubrick was the only director who had any ideas of how to tackle a film version of Lolita. I also believe that he was the only director who could have succeeded, and I believe he did succeed. This film was everything I could have expected it to be, and maybe even a little more.Shelley Winters' performance was wonderful! James Mason delivered a strong effort in a very difficult part to play. Peter Sellers was Peter Sellers, four or five times throughout the movie, but that's Peter Sellers, and that's why I am really starting to admire his work. The real surprise performance in this movie, however, came from Sue Lyon in the title role. Her intensity was incredible. She seemed perfectly natural as a teenage girl enjoying the attention of older men, or just men in general. You could really see the wheels turning in her head as she schemed her way from one situation to the other. Some have criticized that her Lolita was \"too old\" in comparison to the novel's Lolita. One could make that judgment, however, what twelve year old actress would have been able to provide the emotional depth required for the part? Let's face it, in literary adaptations, some license must be allowed. All in all, I thought it was a very good movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the work of Stanley Kubrick and/or Peter Sellers.",

It was last seen with only the masts standing above the water. Two of the crew died: the Captain, Robin Walbridge, and Claudene Christian, the direct descendant of Fletcher Christian.",
    "review": "For the life of me, I have never been able to understand why the 1962 version of the \"Bounty\" tale is so maligned.  It is a magnificent movie, stunningly photographed.  It is not a perfect film, but it is undeniably entertaining.  I actually (dare I say it?) enjoy it more than the original 1935 version that is so revered.I can understand that some viewers balk at Marlon Brando's affected foppishness.  IMO, however, the actor is taking a calculated risk in attempting to illustrate the profound transformation that Fletcher Christian undergoes as the story progresses.  It does not always ring true, but, taken as a whole, it works very well.  Some moments are brilliant.  By the time we reach the actual mutiny, his growing rage (which has been suppressed almost imperceptibly up to this point) explodes in a massive rush and instantly we see a side of Christian that we weren't quite sure existed.  His self-serving has finally given way to inevitable sympathy for the much-abused crew and even a sort of new-found idealism.However, it is Trevor Howard's performance as Lt. Bligh which is the backbone of this movie.  This man IS Bligh.  At first he seems approachable and even affable, but each succeeding scene reveals some new brush stroke of character that illustrates the single-minded, ruthless soul of stone contained within.  Howard also has this playfully mischievous smile that, every now and then, leads you to believe that there may be some glimmer of warmth inside the man.  This hope, of course, is dashed to pieces every time.\"Mutiny on the Bounty\" is also a strong example of how a soundtrack can make a film.  This music always gives me goosebumps.  From the overture through intermission to closing, it sets the tone of the picture brilliantly as a seafaring drama/adventure.  It sounds like the ocean.  It sounds the way the cinematography looks.  Vast panoramas of blue ocean, endless skies, lush green tropical islands, and, most of all, the ship itself (which was built specifically for this film).  And the icing on the cake is the song \"Follow Me\", one of the most hauntingly beautiful melodies ever written for the screen.  To me (here I go again), it sounds like Tahiti.Watch \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" in letterbox and full stereophonic sound and THEN see if you don't like it.",

It is an enlightening film for most Westerners who only learn of the Crusades through traditional Orientalist views.  It does a great job in eliminating typical stereotypes of the Arab world at the time, but is fair in its representation of both sides.  The film shows the aggressiveness of the Catholic armies, but also the treachery and deceit that plagued the Arab world.  It also treats Richard the Lion-Hearted with the respect he deserves, and the most spectacular scene is a split screen comparison of Salah al-Din and Richard, that shows how the men were so alike, but caught on opposite sides of a war.

For months I watched the movie on an almost daily basis, and it was quickly a favorite. I thought it was absolute perfection.Now that I am a bit older.. I notice that is does have quite a few flaws. It doesn't really capture the essence of Shaw's Pygmalion, but I don't think that should really take away from the movie; they should be treated as separate entities. Some of the sets are a little, well, cramped, but consider what they had to work with, they did a pretty good job. And then there is the dubbing issue. I recently special on MFL on AMC, and they showed \"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\" and \"Show Me\" with Audrey's voice, and though Audrey may not have the perfect melodic voice of Marni Nixon, her voice was much more \"Eliza\". I really do think they should have just used her voice. If you watch \"Funny Face\", you get a good feel for voice, which I think is beautiful in a unconventional way. Then, there is the question of whether Julie Andrews should have played Eliza in the film version of MFL. I've gone back and forth on this issue. Now, Audrey Hepburn is my favorite actress of all time, and Julie Andrews is a close runner-up, so it really is hard to \"choose\". Of course Julie's voice is much better than even Marni Nixon's... but like I said before, I don't think a perfect singing voice really would suit Eliza. And as for which would play a better Eliza overall.. I really don't know. I wasn't alive to see MFL on Broadway, so I really can't compare the two. What I do know is that Audrey gave an amazing performance. Anyway, as someone else said, if Julie had played Eliza, who would have played Mary Poppins? ;)",

He was all cold and discerning and unflappable on the exterior; he was ageing and full of self-doubt on the inside....Even the final session of the poker game was real...I played that game as if it were for blood. It was one of the best performances I ever gave on stage or screen or radio or TV, and the reason for it is that is wasn't a performance at all; it was symbolically the playing out of my whole gamble with life.\"",
    "review": "Steve McQueen's answer to Paul Newman's huge success with The Hustler isn't quite as good as the earlier classic; but it's still a damn fine movie. Poker is a fascinating game, and it therefore makes a great base for a film. The Cincinnati Kid capitalises on that fact and it draws all of it's excitement from the game at it's centre. The type of poker played in this movie is 5 card stud; and as a Texas Hold'Em fan, I was a little disappointed by this as stud simply isn't as good; but poker is poker, and 5 card stud is still an admirable base for a film. As implied, the film is at it's best when we're watching the action on the table; and it's easy to liken the structure of this movie to that of a disaster movie, in that it's central theme is the focus and the plot is then bulked out by human drama. The drama side of the story follows Eric Stoner (McQueen), a gambling man who's been honing his skills and working his way up to a game with 'The Man' (Edward G. Robinson). However, things are never that simple as when there's money involved; there's always someone willing to force it to go their way.Steve McQueen makes a great leading man. His cocky swagger and charisma are always a delight to watch, but this combines with his off-screen personality, and when watching him I cant help but think about his big headedness when it comes to film billing and the like. However; he's not the star of this movie in my eyes, as it's Edward G. Robinson that takes that honour. Robinson is a fantastic actor, and one that rarely gets his dues when it comes to deciding the greatest actors of all time. Here, he adds great believability to his role as the top poker player and he ensures that the atmosphere around his player is one of confidence and authority. And that's how it should be - he is the man. The Cincinnati Kid is exciting throughout; but never more so than on the build up to it's conclusion. The ending is one of my favourite of all time, and Robinson's line shortly after the end stands up with the greatest lines ever written for cinema. While this film is no Hustler; it's still a damn good movie, and one that I hugely recommend. Especially if you're a poker player!",

    "review": "No wonder the highest directorial achievement for direction of the British Academy of Film and Television is named after David Lean. An artist who knew how to combine great performances, with breathtaking settings, haunting soundtrack, in order to create works of art that are to remain as pillars for the future generations of film-makers.\"Doctor Zhivago\" is definitely one of his most outstanding works, a film that breathes with life, and suffers with passion. Neither, though, of the credited people can take as much credit for it, as David Lean. Omar Sharif delivers one of his best performances of his career, Julie Christie has never been as stunning, or Rod Steiger as Komarovsky or Tom Courtenay as Antipov ever left more memorable performances than these ones. Not even Maurice Jarre, who composed one of the most unforgettable themes in film history, or Robert Bolt, for his skillful adaptation on Pasternak's difficult novel, not even Freddy Young's cinematography, can rise above the vibration of genius, which is David Lean. We almost feel the complexity of the universe collapsing on us with a mad power that we instantly become part of it, and fall in love with all its particles.For those who haven't seen the film, this might make little sense, and it can give a misleading understanding of what one is to expect. \"Doctor Zhivago\" is a poet, who at the beginning of the 20th Century is caught in the historical Bolshevik revolution. An outstanding doctor, married to his childhood friend, Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin in a warm performance), finds that there is beauty beyond deceit, love beyond commitment, by starting an affair with an enigmatic lady which appears often in his path in the most unnoticeable of moments. Their destiny is as confused as Russia in the turmoil started by the Reds, it is shaped by history without their approval. There is no solution for a country that abandoned its passions in its desire of self-improvement, just as for the two lovers, which find themselves abandoned in the middle of the Siberian taiga.This is a slow film and for the good reasons. We are allowed to breathe the story, to give it momentum, and to judge it from within, as if the choices were not Yury's, Lara's or Tonya's, but our own creation. And this is the brilliance of Lean's direction. The story transcends time and space, and it melts within the triviality of our life. Beyond it, we are left with nothing but love, pure and blindingly real.",

    "review": "Whether you love or hate it, Bonnie and Clyde was, and remains to this day, a ground-breaking film in the history of American cinema, and should be praised hugely for that alone. Aside from the re-defining techniques of showing violence on-screen and the depiction of main characters who are far from typical heroes, it contains career-boosting roles for many actors, and comes from a very talented director of the time, Arthur Penn.The story follows the titular real-life bandit couple of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker. The story traces them from first meeting, and follows their crime-spree throughout a Depression-era America with their gang, robbing banks, evading police and creating a notorious reputation for themselves. The film is slightly romanticised, depicting the couple as young, foolish kids who don't really seem to realise what they're getting into, but the violent and unpredictable undertone and the impressive period detail ensures an edge that lifts it above typical gangster movies, and always assures us that what's happening isn't remotely romantic, while granting the characters and events gritty depth.Penn is on fine form from the beginning, and handles a range of different scenes with ease and a huge amount of skill, from thrilling banks-robberies and shootouts, to the more intimate character scenes, in particular those between Bonnie and Clyde, which depict one of the most interesting and unusual screen couples to date. The cinematography and editing are used to huge effect, and resulted in some of the most ground-breaking scenes of the 60's, while the folk-style soundtrack gives an air of humour.The film tends to play a bit fast-and-loose with the facts- like condensing several real-life members of the gang into the single character C.W. Moss, and neglecting the fact that for nearly a year, Bonnie was almost unable to walk due to a car crash, but writers David Newman and Robert Benton can be forgiven for these inaccuracies considering they succeeded in crafting a story that is both thrilling and exciting as well as tragic and thought-provoking.But the story would be nothing without first-rate cast it boasts. Warren Beatty as Clyde excels in the multi-layered, dramatic role that he had sought after for so long, and more than succeeded in his attempt to be taken seriously as an actor. Beatty's depiction of a confident, intelligent, but naive young man looking to make his name and fortune is spot-on, and while romanticised to a certain degree, is never glorified. His Clyde is more than matched by Faye Dunaway's Bonnie, who gives a hugely convincing portrayal of an everyday girl getting caught up in something she should never have become part of. The two have an excellent and very unusual chemistry, even by today's standards, and work together brilliantly as a man not used to such intimacy and a woman desperate to live the romantic life of an outlaw with him.The supporting players may not be quite as strong as the leads, but hold their own quite well, particularly Gene Hackman as Buck. In my opinion one of the greatest actors of all time, Hackman gives a brilliant performance that's both spirited and grounded as Clyde's brother, expressing the same wide-eyed desire for the life of an outlaw as the others and maintains a hugely convincing brotherly relationship with Beatty throughout. Michael Pollard also performs well as gang member C.W, whose quiet demeanour assures his character stands out, despite being relatively small. Estelle Parsons suffers with Blanche, a supremely annoying character that personally I found too irritating. But in fairness, that's precisely the intention behind the character, and Parsons certainly manages to convey it. Throw in one of Gene Wilder's first screen performances and you have an extremely talented and interesting cast.But aside from the great cast and direction, the truly ground-breaking, incredibly influential aspect of the film is much simpler and much more important- the depiction of on-screen violence and the impact it makes. For the first time, when people were shot or killed, it looked like it hurt. Bad. Penn and his crew pushed boundaries that before, hadn't even been considered. Suddenly, violence was being portrayed in a gritty, shocking and unsettling way. For the first time, screen violence was truly violent. This is what made the story of a group of young and naive people deciding to become criminals so powerful- the fact that we really saw what that really meant. We see what it's like to be shot, and this helps to drive home their story with such impact and power. This was the first step taken that shaped the entire future of motion-picture, and inspired other films to follow it's example, such as The Wild Bunch, and later films like MASH and Jaws that continued to push the limits of what could be done on screen.Now, I am definitely NOT a fan of gore or extreme violence. Give me E.T and Toy Story before all the Saws and Texas Chainsaw Massacres in the world. But that doesn't mean violence in films is wrong. Violence can be a means of driving home a point, or setting a film's atmosphere, or at times it can even just be pretty damn satisfying. But whether you're a pacifist or a gore-hound, it can't be denied that violence in films is prominent, and many times it's done well, while other times it's not. This film revolutionised it. And more than that, it gave film-makers the influence to do other new things, and was the perfect film to kick-start the revolutionary era of the late 60's and 70's, and inspired them to use their own ideas rather than what would make money.This is a very special film. Personally, not one of my favourites, but it deserves a good 8 out of 10 purely for its historical relevance and powerhouse cast. It may not be perfect, but if you haven't seen it, see it, and know that you're watching history being made.",

The kind of angles and perspectives the camera uses, the way it zooms in and out or even allows itself (literally) to get dirty - the way this whole picture was shot is just something I haven't seen in an American film released prior to this one. And yet, although it is considered a classic, when people talk about the \"New Hollywood\" somehow 'Cool Hand Luke' is hardly ever mentioned - despite the fact that it came out only a couple of months after 'Bonnie and Clyde' in 1967 and before 'The Graduate'. I look at this film mainly as a character study but the story arc also works very well and it hasn't aged a bit. This is one of those rare films that was way ahead of its time and which has simply everything: great acting, iconic characters and scenes, wonderful music - and the cinematography is just unbelievable. Funny, tragic and moving, 'Cool Hand Luke' is one hell of a film.

The black and white film is a bit detached and withdrawn on purpose and it helps to build a certain menacing suspense. Heroism is shown here as a very usual, almost casual event, not a beautiful pose, but a gray, morbid bravery in face of imminent death. There are many simply soldiers and officers who do their duty and they defend the territory at their best, despite a sure feeling that many will fall. A sad, bitter and acid tale is very deep and real, slow camera work helps to show many faces of gruesome death. What makes this film not totally perfect is a certain lack of deeper character build-up, as well as some slightly hammy dialog that lose some of the sharpness.

    "plot": "In his book \"Keep Moving\", Dick Van Dyke mentioned during the \"Toot Sweets\" segment, at 40 years old, he never bothered to warm up before a dance number. During filming, he felt something pop in his leg. He thought he had merely pulled a muscle, but soon after he couldn't walk without limping. He went to a doctor, who told him his whole body was full of arthritis, and within five years he wouldn't be able to get around at all without a cane or a wheelchair. Van Dyke responded to this prognosis by jumping up and dancing, which astounded the doctor. Almost 50 years later, in his brief role as Mr. Dawes Jr. in Mary Poppins kommer tillbaka (2018), 92-year-old Van Dyke danced without any assistance.",
    "review": "It's fifty years-old this year and it still hit the mark. \nI watched this with my eldest son when he was about 6 and he loved it. But, I just forgot about it as time went by. He's 14 now. \nI put it on last night for my other two kids, who are 10 & 5, well they loved it. Watched it again the very next day. My teenage son even sat in and watched it too. They sing the theme song now while driving. \nThe only bad point to me is that it's a very long movie and it can seem a little slow at times. Probably not a bad thing to a kid though, mine never complained.\nThey asked questions about \"the olden days\" as it's onviously set even many years before it was made. I loved the questions and the insight into a different time of story telling. He movie was at least 25 years old when I saw it and it seemed old to me then. But I loved it. \nGreat movie.\n Don't be turned off thinking kids won't like it compared to modern kid and family movies. It's dated but that's not a bad thing.",

    "plot": "According to Mia Farrow, the scenes where Rosemary walks in front of traffic were spontaneous and genuine. Roman Polanski is reported to have told her that \"nobody will hit a pregnant woman.\" The scene was successfully shot with Farrow walking into real traffic and Polanski following, operating the hand-held camera since he was the only one willing to do it.",
    "review": "Every bit of acclaim that Rosemary's Baby has earned is totally deserved. The Dakota, located at 72nd and Central Park West, is the perfect setting for the demonic events; all that rich Gothic detail in the heart of Manhattan provides the perfect atmosphere, serving as a dark fairy-tale world of its own within the modern setting. Roman Polanski knows this and utilizes it brilliantly, opening the film with stunning aerial shots of the skyline and focusing in on the ornate castle amongst the skyscrapers and tenements.The acting is fantastic, particularly Mia Farrow, who is the only person I can envision as Rosemary. Her fine-boned fragility makes her the ideal target for terror. She goes from obliviousness to suspicion to fear to near madness without showing a seam, and we as the audience are with her all the way. And Mia is given a run for her money by the delightful Ruth Gordon, a comical yet sinister presence popping in on a deliberate schedule with pale green drinks and sandpapery advice. She's scary because we know her--a batty old broad with a seemingly sweet nature beneath her caustic surface. That such a person could possibly be a vessel of evil is a thoroughly unnerving concept.Unnerving is the proper adjective for the entire movie. Unnerving, eerie, and penetratingly frightening in a very subtle manner. The subtlety is key, since a more explicit treatment would've spoiled everything. As the tension heightens, we feel what Rosemary feels: Curiosity, then vague suspicion, then paralyzing terror at the final revelation. At all times, the movie retains its dignity, from the opening and closing shots of the building to the flourishing title script to the beautiful music. Even on TV, this picture can chill you to the bone. The best big-budget horror movie of all time.",

Shammi Kapoor not only had many box office hits in the 1960s but also had such a fantastic filmography throughout the decade. He started with Singapore, Junglee, and Professor, and then ended the most memorable decade of his office career with Prince. This film is so underrated, not because it is something great, but because it is on par with the other most loved or popular movies of the actor and hasn't gotten enough hype from critics and audiences. Prince has a fantastic story of a prince getting into an ordinary man's shoes to learn the truth of life and hard work. We have seen this formula in old Hollywood movies from the 1930s and then a couple of Bollywood movies in the late 1950s. Instead of Prince, the hero was like the son of a rich man, who would run away or would be thrown out of the house. Same formula, but a different person. What follows is even more interesting, as the prince actually starts enjoying the life of an ordinary man and then finds himself in a difficult situation where he can neither tell his reality nor hide it. It is such a freaking good setup of events and characters. The prince, the princess, the blind mother, and the antagonist-this is how you write a script that brings entertainment as well as reliability to the narrative. Shammi Kapoor, what a charmer! Don't think anybody came close to him in the 1960s. Badan Pe Sitaare will remain iconic forever. Vyjayanthimala returned to the silver screen after her marriage, and what a lovely princess she made here. Professor, Amrapali, Jhuk Gaya Asman, and then Prince-everybody look at Lekh Tandon's filmography. This man actually knew how to entertain the audience, and he did it so well. We just need to appreciate him a little more.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",

    "review": "Like most Americans, I have seen hundreds, maybe thousands of westerns in my life.  I don't care for them much, primarily because I usually can't fall for them.In movies, the desire to please as wide an audience as possible seems always to win out, effectively robbing most westerns of the motion picture's essential gambit; the suspension of disbelief.  It's very hard to lose oneself in a tale of the late 1800's when the female lead's eye-liner and coiff are pure 1950.  Or 1940, 1960, whatever.  In True Grit, very little of 1969 is allowed to intrude on this rather simple tale of justice and revenge.  This movie is anchored by two very strong themes, shared by all the actors, across most of the scenes.The first, is language.  The dialogue is an absolute delight.  Crack open anything by Mark Twain, Henry James or any other late 19th century author, and you will see that people really did speak differently 150 years ago. That the dialogue in 99% of westerns is straight from the time of their filming is a travesty, at best.Second, is innocence.  Not that of any one character however, but the innocence of the human race as a whole.  It is probably almost impossible for any of us now, in this day and age, to truly imagine what it must have been like to live back when.  But one thing's sure, people were much more naive.  There was no such thing as mass-communication, a good percentage of the population didn't read, and newspapers, the only \"organized\" form of news at the time, were hard pressed to report on anything more than a day's ride from town.This basic, shared innocence is achingly portrayed by Robert Duvall in two short sentences near the end of the movie when he's caught Mattie and he's attempting to threaten her.  Study those two lines, and you'll see that \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper, the worst villain in the story, really has no idea of what he could possibly do to a slip of a girl.  He's totally at a loss.  The unspeakable, modern-day atrocities we consume every day with our coffee and bagels are so far from contemplation by Duvall's character, that all he can do is assure her, \"I'll do what I have to\". It's a priceless moment - frighteningly accurate commentary wrapped in two lines of simple dialogue, delivered with dead-on interpretation.The only other western I can think of at the moment that delivers with such viscerally historic accuracy is \"Unforgiven\".\nMjM",

The main character, who eventually takes power of the boat, arrives on it with no tickets, and gains a position by mistake, but is still able to use it to form a kind of politburo, and then a dictatorship.The film manages to do all this whilst being a hilarious comedy, some of the humour could perhaps be difficult for non-Polish viewers to comprehend. Not that much ACTUALLY goes on on the boat, but what goes on can easily be related to external events, and because of the way it is acted, this is a film that never gets boring, against all odds. If this film had gained widespread international fame and distribution, it would probably gain cult status all over the world, and be treated as one of the best films of all time, as it is in Poland.",

There's no denying that the book is sheer genius, but in all honesty this film adaptation is exceptionally well made too. In fact, it comes high up on my list of all-time movie favourites.The Wonka Chocolate Factory is an amazing building from which some of the most scrumdiddlyumptious sweets are delivered to the world's candy stores. Wonka-mania hits the world when five golden tickets are hidden inside packs of Wonka bars - for the winners will be granted a tour of the top-secret factory. Young Charlie Bucket, a poor boy whose family cottage lies within sight of Wonka's factory, dreams of becoming a winner - but with barely a penny to his name, does he have a chance?What makes Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory such a success is the way it skillfully blends entertainment and a serious underlying moral. Each winning child is exposed as being rotten-to-the-core, then dealt with harshly and dismissively by Wonka. Seeing these awful brats get their come-uppance is hilarious, enjoyable and - on a serious level - quite eye-opening (it's as if parents in the audience are being told how to prevent their children from turning bad). Gene Wilder was simply born to play Wonka (every eccentric phrase, every bemused expression, and every mischievous glance is judged to perfection). The film's set design is fabulous, with particular high-spots including the chocolate room, the egg room and the wacky corridor which gets smaller and narrower the closer you get to the end. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is simply magic - a film that everyone must see, especially parents whose kids are just becoming that bit too big for their boots!",

    "plot": "The movie opened in theaters in 1972 the same week that Jane Fonda made her controversial trip to Hanoi, North Vietnam. Within a week of its release, American-International Pictures withdrew it from circulation. Director Francine Parker speculated that \"calls were made from high up in Washington, possibly from the Nixon White House, and the film just disappeared.\"",
    "review": "http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/rothermel010409.html FTA -- Now More Than Ever by Jay RothermelFTA (Dir. Francine Parker, 1972).Preamble: \"This film was made in association with the servicewomen and men stationed on the United States bases of the Pacific Rim, together with their friends whose lands they presently occupy.\" Accepting his Oscar for Best Actor, Sean Penn jokingly referred to the Academy as lovers of \"commies and homos.\" It's a tribute to the low level of politics among our cultural workers today that Sean Penn would be surprised at acknowledgement of his performance. The Academy loves movies about exceptional heroes, whether they are overcoming physical disabilities, sports team segregation, the Holocaust, or the Roman Empire.The entertainment industrial complex also loves it when its celebrities serve as a prophylactic for US humanitarian imperialism in countries like Sudan or Tibet. (Poor Rose McGowan, conversely, hasn't been heard or seen since expressing understanding for what motivated men and women in Ireland to join the IRA.) All of which brings us to the opposite end of the movie food chain, far from the heights of Oscardom: FTA, Francine Parker's documentary about the \"Free the Army\" tour. Washington and Wall Street long ago erased this movie. The miracle of globalized media today, however, means we can sit at home and watch it on DVD or its showing on that greener-than-green parrot cage called the Sundance Channel.What strikes the viewer first about FTA is the humility, sense of proportion, and optimism the film has about events it depicts. We are a long way here from the old Michael Moore bazooka and the longeurs of Ken Burns, Inc.There are many similarities between FTA and the great rock concert documentaries of the same period: only a few lines of narration for context, and then getting out of the way of the performances.FTA the movie was long ago blacklisted from theaters, just as FTA the traveling political musical extravaganza was blacklisted from history. A key part of the \"culture war\" trumpeted by media and academic hacks of the Bill Bennett-David Horowitz-Rush Limbaugh variety (and which is itself part of a larger 30 year war against the gains of the labor, civil rights, women's, and anti-war movements) is the depiction of the those opposed to the Vietnam War as \"stabbing our troops in the back.\" One tonic effect of FTA's DVD release and Sundance showing is to put the lie to that libel. As Washington's invasion and war against the people of Vietnam proceeded, one of the greatest concentrations of anti-war sentiment and activism was found among GIs themselves. The script for the FTA revue itself was drawn exclusively from material GIs published in their own anti-war newspapers.FTA was the product of a flourishing anti-war culture. Today we see this culture boiled down to a History Channel \"flower power\" documentary, histories like Tom Brokaw's Boom, and the memoirs of Senators and ex-Senators like John Kerry and Bob Kerry. But Vietnam's war of independence at its height inspired militants around the world, from Che Guevara's guerillas to the 1968 strikers in France.One of the great pleasures of FTA is the forthright energy of the performers and their audience. The GIs heard their own thoughts -- salty, sarcastic, and full of gallows humor and solidarity at the same time -- repeated back to them. The leaps of consciousness over just a few years as they rejected each rationale of the Washington war machine confirmed the anti-war movement's strategy of orienting to these \"workers in uniform.\" The cast of the FTA revue is filled with gifted performers. They continued with their artistic careers after the U.S. anti-war tide receded. It is a pleasure to see them in their youth, energized by work that gave shape to the feelings of the immense majority. Between concerts they marched in solidarity with local activists protesting Washington's devastating \"military base colonialism\" in the Philippines, Okinawa, and Japan.Today one of the movie FTA's great strengths is its potential as a recruiting tool. It is the perfect length to have classes, meetings, and potlucks built around it. The moral authority of the movie is without equal: completely ignoring the pundits and the bi-partisan Wall Street war party in Washington, it lets the anti-war GIs speak for themselves.Jay Rothermel lives in Cleveland, Ohio.",

    "review": "A famed, and infamous, movie director, JJ Hannaford, dies in a car accident. He was about to release his latest movie and a documentary camera crew had been following him around in the days preceding his death. We see the events leading up to his death, the careers Hannaford destroyed, the enemies he made and his last film, The Other Side of the Wind.Written and directed by the great Orson Welles, this movie has taken nearly 50 years to be released. Welles started shooting it in 1970 and by his death in 1985 it had not been released. Production issues and politics prevented this. Now, in 2018, Netflix has released it. Being a huge fan of Orson Welles, the thought of seeing his long-dormant final film released was an exciting one.However, the final product is quite disappointing. It looks and feels unfinished, a mashup of random scenes. While watching I thought that this was due to the film being in an unedited state when Welles died and it was edited to the final version after his death. Turns out the final version had already been edited by Welles, so we can't blame Netflix's production team.The film-within-a-film element was initially intriguing but is ultimately confusing. What is part of Hannaford's film and what is Welles's film? Are the pretentious, trippy, hippy sequences and the gratuitous nudity and sex scenes Welles trying to appeal to early-70s arty audiences or his take on the pretentiousness of modern movies?I would like to think that one of the themes of the movie is the pretentiousness of Hollywood, so will give Welles the benefit of the doubt on the content. However, it does become a jarring, disconcerting experience when you have seemingly-gratuitous scenes like those thrown randomly into the movie.This said, it is not all bad. Welles's take on Hollywood, its movies and the pretentiousness of the times is well directed (if, indeed, that was his aim. It's so difficult to tell). The mystery surrounding John Dale adds intrigue. The story of JJ Hannaford is interesting and John Huston is perfect in the role. He pretty much just had to play himself!Even here, however, Welles overeggs the pudding. I would have been more engaged in the Hannaford story if there weren't so many scenes that added nothing to plot or character development. So many scenes that just take up space and so much long, pointless dialogue. There's no momentum to the movie at all and the ending is a damp squib.",

In his birthday party he catches a glimpse of Bobby (Dimple Kapadia). Raja is swept away, and for him, it's love at first sight.Raja finds out that Bobby is the granddaughter of his governess Mrs. Briganza (Durga Khote). All his life, Raja had treated Mrs. Briganza more like his mother than his own mom, Sushma (Sonia Sahani). Bobby's dad is a fisherman named Jack Briganza (Prem Nath), who definitely likes his rum. He longs nothing more in the world than his daughter to be happy.Raja and Bobby start to get to know each other better. And as they had suspected, they were soul mates. Now all they needed was permission to get married.But they soon learn that the road may not be as smooth as they'd predicted. Raja's dad, Nath (Pran), has a lot of pride in his money and his \"khandaan\". Nath doesn't get along with Jack...and because of this, Raja and Bobby and prohibited from seeing each other.But as the world knows, love has no boundaries...but in this case, could it be possible that Raja and Bobby can never be together? Was money that big of a deal? Or will it be a happy ending? Watch Bobby to find out! I certainly loved this movie! The star cast was chosen nicely. Rishi Kapoor delivers a strong screen presence all while being pinch-my-cheek cute! Adorable I tell ya! Dimple Kapadia also looks cute in many scenes, and acts pretty good. Aruni Irani is wonderful in her role, and the character she played was expressed very well through her actions. Pran, well, what can I say? Akhir Pran hi tho hai! Woh hume kabhi disappoint nahin karega! Prem Nath acted nicely, and so did Durga Khote. Sonia Sahani had a small role, but she played it well to a nice extent. Farida Jalal had a significant special appearance. She played it perfectly.The music! My god the music! Laxmikant-Pyarelal made beautiful evergreen tunes! The songs...the background music...everything was absolutely perfect. Well, except one thing. This is my opinion, but I didn't think there was any need to use Shailendra Singh for these marvelous songs. I think even more beauty could have been added to the songs if someone like Rafi, Kishore, or Mukesh had sung the songs. Besides, SS's voice didn't even suit Rishi that well.I just have to talk about Lata of course! She once again proves how extremely flawlessly beautiful her voice is. When I finished watching the movie, her melodious voice continued to sing in my head. All the duets like \"Hum Tum Ek Kamre Mein\", \"Mujhe Kuch Kehna Hai\", and \"Jhoot Bole Kauva Kaate\" are sung perfectly by Lata. Her solo \"Aye Phansa\" is quite enjoyable too, it shows her versatility. Her one-line song, \"Akhiyon Ko Rehne Do\", is quite effective in the movie.The hit song \"Mein Shayar Tho Nahin\" is composed perfectly...the lyrics are quite nice too. \"Na Chahoon Sona Chandi\" is quite entertaining, Manna Dey sings very nicely.And last but not least, the direction by our showman Raj Kapoor. It was great, every scene is directed and edited with care, in order for the movie to be organized as well as entertaining. Some scenes made me cry. The character development is displayed well through the direction. One flaw though, and this is just my opinion. Sometimes the shorts/skirts for Dimple are just too short, and tended to give her a sleazy look. I was just waiting to see her in a pretty sari, but unfortunately I didn't get to see that.But anyway, \"Bobby\" is definitely a classic. I give it a nine out of ten. Definitely worth watching.",

    "review": "'Cleopatra Jones' is one of my favourite 1970s exploitation movies. While technically blaxploitation it bears very little resemblance to the grittiness and relative realism of 'Shaft', 'Superfly' or 'Black Caesar'. It is closer to 'Black Belt Jones' meets James Bond, especially the spectacular opening sequence in Turkey. If you don't take it too seriously this is fantastic fun.Tamara Dobson is beautiful, sassy and kick ass as Special Government Agent Cleopatra Jones, enemy to drug pushers everywhere. Her lover's (Bernie Casey - 'Never Say Never Again') half-way house is under threat of closure after a dubious drug bust. Cleo suspects the involvement of a crooked cop (the always menacing Bill McKinney - 'Deliverance'), and local drug big wig Mommy (Shelley Winters as a larger than life lesbian leather queen!). Mommy and her henchmen (one of which is the legendary Paul Koslo - 'The Omega Man') try everything in their power to stop Cleopatra, but hell, look at her moves! her clothes! her Afro! Who do you think is gonna win here?!A stylish, silly and wonderfully entertaining trash classic. Directed by Jack Starrett ('Slaughter', 'Race With The Devil') and co-written and produced by actor Max Julien ('Psych-Out', 'The Mack'). 'Cleopatra Jones' is a must see for 70s buffs.",

The interviews of contemporaries like Peter Townshend, Eric Clapton, and Mick Jagger, reveal that, when Hendrix arrived in Swinging London, in 1966, he was viewed as somewhat of a sideshow, playing the guitar with his teeth, and behind his back. Townshend admits they were in awe, and perhaps threatened by him. As Hendrix's brilliance spread, being in his company conferred credibility, attracting devotees and posers.I loved Little Richard reminiscing about their early days playing together. The Jimi Hendrix that emerges is that of a decent human being thoroughly enjoying the fame, aware of, and in love with his talent. The concert clips and performances are awesome. Hendrix died in 1970, we can only imagine what he would have accomplished as the music scene transitioned into disco, punk rock, synth pop, rap.",

    "review": "Scorsese's first film, the interesting catastrophe \"Boxcar Bertha,\" marked his birth as a director, but it was with his second feature, \"Mean Streets\" that we witnessed the birth of an artist. Most of \"Mean Streets\" is slightly unfocused with a simplistic plot based around a lot of machismo grandstanding and long bouts of boring dialog (occasionally made interesting by DeNiro's off-kilter star-making turn as Johnny-Boy), with spats of visceral violence (far less gory here than in later Scorcese pics), and a visual bravado that seems slightly less disciplined but no less entertaining than your standard Scorsese crime flick.Despite its drawbacks (mainly due to youth and inexperience), the template was set. The opening credits (done to the tune of \"Be My Baby\") suck you right into the film, and the rest of the movie is peppered with Scorsese's loving treatment of popular music that would later become one of his most endearing hallmarks. The basic premise featuring Harvey Keitel as Charlie (the young hood with a heart of gold and conflicted internally by the religion of the Church and the religion of the Streets), Robert DeNiro as Johnny-Boy (the equally loved and hated loose-canon brother figure), and Amy Robinson as Theresa (the woman our hero wants to put on a pedestal as a saint but often treats like a whore), is a trifecta of archetypes we see repeated again and again in Scorsese's films (most obviously in \"Casino\" with the DeNiro-Pesci-Stone characters, and most subversively in \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" with Jesus-Judas-Mary Magdalene). The religious iconography, the brotherhood of crooks, the attraction to the gangster lifestyle, the keen eye for depicting violence in artistic and startling ways...these are displayed here in \"Mean Streets\" in their rawest form.Though flawed in many ways, \"Mean Streets\" set the stage and laid the the template for the type of film Scorsese would perfect seventeen years later with \"Goodfellas.\" This heralded the arrival of a new talent and a new genre, and the world of film has thankfully never been the same.",

Luckily, his work, including Hotel Pacific (1975) and Lesson in a Dead Language (1979) is beginning to be available in the streaming services and You Tube.The movie: Widmar, a wealthy industrialist is jealous to the point of obsession of his very sexy wife Ewa, whom he suspects of carrying an affair with her physician, Dr. Tamten (there may be a joke here since \"tamten\" means \"that\" or \"that one\"). What follows is a black comedy take on Widmar's tragicomic efforts to prove his suspicions (which includes sending spies after his wife) and to take revenge on the suspected culprit.Acting is excellent, as usual in Polish movies. Production values are also high; in particular, cinematography and set design recreate faithfully the look and feel of a wealthy European milieu between the wars, aided by haunting tango music in the background.

    "review": "Starring the incomparable Ellen Burstyn, giving an Oscar-winning performance (one of the finest of the 1970s), this comedy-drama is gritty and tough, but never off-putting. After her husband dies, 35-year-old Alice Hyatt from New Mexico and her smart-mouthed 11-year-old son (Alfred Lutter) take to the road, chasing her girlhood dream of finding songbird success in Monterey, CA. They get stuck in Phoenix, where she meets up with a frightening working-stiff in a cowboy hat (Harvey Keitel). Later, waitressing at Mel & Ruby's Cafe in Tucson, she meets a gentle farmer (Kris Kristofferson) who's had his share of heartbreak. Perceptive, amusing, knockabout film regarding ordinary people trying to make it, episodes in their lives that enrich or derail them. Alice and her son have a wonderfully natural give-and-take, and the oddballs they meet on their odyssey (like Jodie Foster's shoplifting tomboy or the sweet, overweight cowboy who gives Alice a singing job) are deliciously silly, yet incredibly real. Burstyn is a joy cutting up with her neighbor in the backyard, having a Coke fight with her kid in a seedy motel, trading quips with Diane Ladd's salty Flo in the diner. Some critics complained that the happy ending felt tacked on, but you come to respect Alice and her choices, and most of the film's little faults are camouflaged by director Martin Scorsese's bittersweet framing and Robert Getchell's vivid screenplay. Far superior to the TV sitcom, \"Alice\", which quickly followed.",

End of prison football in Georgia.",
    "review": "Tongue and Cheek satire and sports movies generally are not exactly two movies genres that you combine together, however Burt Reynolds did not believe that, and as a result he starred in a movie that manages to be funny, poignant, intense, and everything in-between. I really don't know how the writers, producers and directors came up with something that turned out to be so awesome. The Longest Yard is masterful, it is funny, but it isn't a comedy, there is a lot of football but it is more than a just a sports movie, this is a hard movie to classify and maybe that is the reason it is so good.Burt Reynolds plays a washed up football player who winds up in the slammer for drunk driving. While there the warden asks him to put together a football team to go up against the prison guards, who play in a semi-professional league. The prisoners are an interesting group of misfits and criminals, played perfectly by the various character actors in the parts. Burt Reynolds manages to be a brilliant lead of all of these crazy cons, and is perfect in this part. This movie is great but it doesn't exactly scream out greatness at first. This is a movie where you will be half way through and you will realize this is just a great movie to watch.Aside from the fact it is just an off-beat movie it is hard to understand why this movie is so good, I don't know why myself, the jokes are not really laugh out loud hysterical, but it becomes apparent the reason this movie is so good is because it really ventured into areas that few films had, and while there are references to racial problems, homosexuality, although very muted, prison violence, crooked law enforcement officials and other issues rarely discussed on screen.What I am surprised at is that these issues become prominent, and something you heed in the movie, and at the same time the over the top satire merges with this movie perfectly. Even watching a movie like this as compared to other comedies that raise marginally controversial issues like racism, such as Police Academy, Police Academy sort of makes a comedy out of racism and sexism, and to a lesser degree a movie like Caddyshack, but this movie puts the comedy and the controversial issues together, not making them one, but two completely different facets of the movie. Normally when you have a movie that is as intense as this it is hard to have such satirical elements in a movie and be a good movie, but this movie combines the two elements so effortlessly.This is definitely an underdog movie, in that the prisoners are supposed to lose, they are a bunch of cons that rarely if ever played football, and have no chance going up against a semi-professional team. The characters, too numerous to name make this movie that much better. The movie also is a prison movie, and is successful at that, this is one of those movies, everything just clicked right, and the result is near perfection. One reason to watch this movie is Eddie Albert, as the ever smiling and smugly pleasant prison warden who is the mastermind of the entire affair, he is just perfect here, so meticulously uttering every word to the point that he looks like he is in pain, and he is perfect in the role. James Hampton also has an excellent part as Reynolds' sidekick in prison. This is just an all around great movie excellent in so many different ways.I watch a movie like this, and I wonder why there are so few movies like this today, movies so offbeat but funny, movies that actually have decent acting, movies that are this interesting, instead of typical silly fare you would get like a dumb teen movie or a dumb action movie. This movie is priceless in a way. When I first heard of the movie I didn't think it would be that good, but when I watched it I realized why it was Oscar nominated and so well thought of. I don't know why it clicked, but it did, and the result is a film definitely worth seeing, and one of the best of the 1970s.",

    "review": "Watching the TV remake of Carrie last week just made me miss the original version all the more. There were so many elements that made the 1976 movie a classic, but I will try to name just a few...First of all, the original actresses could never be replaced. Sissy Spacek as Carrie White goes without saying. Sissy gave Carrie a child-like quality that no other actress can touch. You not only root for Spacek's Carrie, but you want to reach in and hug her. Equally irreplacable was Piper Laurie who brings a manic energy to her role as the religious-wacko Mrs. White. I loved how Piper and Sissy's southern accents enhanced their characters. I don't know if it was Stephen King's intention or not, but the way Carrie said \"Momma\" was just so southern. It was fun seeing Piper and Sissy reunited onscreen as southern sisters in the Grass Harp. Two supporting actresses in the film who get little credit are Amy Irving and Betty Buckley. Irving brought an intelligent, thoughtful depth to the character of Sue Snell. Buckley as the caring gym teacher stole every scene she was in. One of the most touching moments was Miss Collins taking Carrie in front of the mirror and telling her that she is a pretty girl. Then the terrible realization on her face as she wonders if it is another cruel joke. And who didn't love it when Buckley slapped Nancy Allen's face?\nMaybe the single most important element in Carrie is the suspense-building music. I can't express how perfectly the music framed every scene. It should have won an oscar for the soundtrack alone. The two beautiful themes still stick in my mind, \"Born To Have It All\" which was playing in the shower scene and \"I Never Dreamed Someone Like You (Could Love Someone Like Me)\" which Carrie and Tommy danced to at the prom. Even the cheesy band playing at the prom fit the mood just right with the lyrics, \"The Devil's Got a Hold Of Your Soul\". Carrie is campy nostalgia. It really is a time capsule of that era in history. The polyester, the gym shorts and knee socks, the afros and farrah-hair just take you back to 1976. Where else can you see the stars of Welcome Back Kotter and Eight Is Enough in the same movie?",

A grim look at the downside of maintaining an \"ideal\", utopian society.  When you hit 30, you either have the option of willingly submitting yourself to be killed under a pretense of renewal, or having the Sandmen play with you before they go in for the kill.  Neither option seems really appealing.  But the idea of one of the killers having to face their mortality is an interesting idea.A little slow in places (but I did keep wanting to see what would happen next), and some of the special effects look really dated (even to '77's \"Star Wars\"), but the story holds up well, and it's an entertaining ride overall.It's truly a classic of the genre, and I wish I had seen it sooner.",

In a featurette on the DVD about making this movie, Eastwood says he'd have people drill Dan George on his lines, but when it came time to shoot the scene, he'd say \"Chief, just forget about the lines, tell me the story about the man who rode over the hill.\" And Dan George, who was apparently a natural storyteller, would then tell the story perfectly.",
    "review": "Clint Eastwood has directed, played in or starred in a lot of westerns. We all have our favorites and this my favorite Eastwood western, along with the more set-in-modern-day western, \"Bronco Billy.\" (The latter is really a drama more than a western.)This is simply an extremely entertaining story with two lead characters - played by Eastwood and Chief Dan George - who were fascinating to watch. Also, as in most westerns, I enjoyed the good photography and was surprised, considering the year of release, that the language was pretty tame.George has always been a favorite Native American actor for many people. He gets choice roles playing likable guys, and \"Lone Watie\" character here is no exception. Eastwood, as \" Josey Wales,\" reverts successfully back to his \"Man with no name\" persona: you know, the strong silent and somewhat mean type. He's a lot like the characters John Wayne played late in his career. He best portrays this with scenes like the one in which he spits tobacco on his dog!In addition, there are some solid actors in minor roles, people like John Vernon, Sondra Locke and Bill McKinney, Will Sampson, Sheb Wooley and Sam Bottoms, among others. I was surprised Locke, Eastwood's girlfriend or wife at the time, didn't have a bigger role. With her youthful looks and great big eyes, she looked prettier than I've ever seen her, although she never was a glamor girl or got many good parts.At 136 minutes, this is a bit long but it never drags. This is one of the very few movies I ever watched twice within two weeks and enjoyed it immensely both times....and each time since.",

    "review": "\"Rocky\" is about a man. It is the story of a man who exceeds past all normal expectations and makes the most out of what he is doing. What is he doing? Boxing. Why? As Rocky says in the film, \"You have to be a moron to want to box.\"Rocky is played by Sylvester Stallone, whose only other film before \"Rocky\" was \"Weekend at Kitty and Stud's,\" and, as you can probably guess by the title, it was an X-rated movie. But Stallone gives just about the best performance of his career here. Before he started getting into recycled action movies and unfunny comedies, the man had talent, as seen shining through in \"Rocky.\" Somewhere along the way he lost that talent, but it's pretty evident that he had it at one time.Stallone wrote the script, which is about a down-on-his-luck Philadelphia man named Rocky Balboa. Rocky is your average tough-guy you see walking down the street, but this film takes a closer look INTO the guy walking past you, and not AT the guy walking past you.He lives in a beat-up, old apartment, infested with roaches, and he barely makes enough money to support himself. His job? Rocky retrieves money for loan sharks. His real job, however, is to break the loaners' thumbs if they don't pay up. He's a muscle man.After he returns from his \"job\" every day, he takes time to do what he has been doing for the past six years, which is boxing. Then, after that, he takes a trip to the local pet store to see the love of his life, Adrian, who works there. He constantly tries to impress her and talk to her, but she is shy and literally does not talk much throughout the entire film.But things change for Rocky after heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) decides that he wants to make a big performance on the 4th of July. He wants to appear nice by letting a regular Joe Schmoe fight him in the ring. All for show, of course. As he is looking through a book of local boxers, he points his finger at the letters THE Italian STALLION, a.k.a. Rocky. He says that fighting an Italian is perfect. \"An Italian found America,\" Creed says. If he fights an Italian-American on the 4th of July, it will be symbolic and will also make Creed look good.But Rocky doesn't realize this is all for show. When he receives word that Apollo Creed wishes to fight him in the ring, Rocky begins to train long and hard with Burgess Meredith, which results in the famous scene where Rocky runs up an entry of stairs in Philly with the music \"Gonna Fly Now\" playing in the background. This scene is spoofed by films world-wide, and it's one of the cornerstones in film history. You will see it all the time. It's just one of those film moments that are marked down in history.The most entertaining thing about \"Rocky\" is how innocent Sylvester Stallone comes across in his role as Rocky. You feel for him when he is trying to impress Adrian and she shrugs him off. The scene where her brother invites Rocky over, and Rocky keeps saying, \"Are you sure she knows I'm coming?\" is a sign of how the guy has been put down. And then when she comes over to his apartment, he acts nice and talks to her. He's not trying any moves on her. He just enjoys being with her. Rocky is a bit of an idiot, as he himself admits, but he's a sweet idiot.And the end, when Rocky fights Apollo Creed, is amazing. A nobody who actually stands a chance against the heavyweight champion of the world. Creed and Rocky are being battered by each other. Creed goes into the opposite corner as Rocky, and one of Creed's managers says, \"This guy thinks this thing is for real -- knock him out!\" You feel sorry for Rocky there, because he is giving the fight all he's got, when it was just a publicity stunt from the beginning, but he didn't even realize it.Things like that are what make \"Rocky\" what it has become over the years. It is a great film, and it has many classic moments that you will see spoofed in films all the time. You should probably see it just for that fact.But the truth is, if you take away all the underlying intricacies, \"Rocky\" is just the story of a simple guy who gets a chance to do something amazing, and he gives it all he's got. I think we've all gone through something like that before, and if so, you will be able to identify with \"Rocky\" all the more.",

    "review": "I loved THE LONGEST DAY when I saw it as a child in the mid 1970s but have gone off it over the years because the characters are more like carichtures rather than real people and the dialogue sounds more like thought processes rather than spoken speech . I guess this is down to Cornelius Ryan not understanding the difference in writing a book and writing a screenplay . The film version of A BRIDGE TOO FAR the second of Ryan's trilogy giving the definitive account of the last year of the war in Europe is superior to THE LONGEST DAY simply because William Goldman has written a superior script than the one Ryan wrote . I can only fault Goldman's script for two things1 ) Some obvious exposition throughout the first 45 minutes , though this probably isn't a fair criticism unlike .....2 ) The Monty bashing . Along with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BAND OF BROTHERS this movie doesn't fail to put the boot into General Bernard Law Montgomery with a bunch of German Generals stating \" Not even Eisenhower would be stupid enough to use Montgomery \" and you do get the impression some people who get their history via war films will quickly come to the conclusion that Monty was the worst commander in human military history , never mind British military history . If Monty had a fault - And the only time it showed itself was during Operation MarketGarden - it was that he was too cautious but it should be remembered that he spent several years fighting on the Western front during the first world war . The likes of Patton , McArthur and future US president Harry S Trumann also fought in that conflict but America didn't enter WW1 until the spring 1917 and didn't contribute to any significant fighting until almost a year later . Unlike the British the future American commanders didn't experience a slaughter house like the Somme which had a profound effect of on Monty's psyche . It should also be remembered that no Western leader was better for turning a holding action into an offensive as seen at El Alamein and there was no better Western leader than Monty for a defensive holding action as seen at operation Goodwood in June 1944 . The problem with operation MarketGarden was logistics , intelligence reports , communications and just plain bad luck , not leadershipThat criticism aside Goldman' script is a good one . Of course some facts and figures have been changed or omitted but the script does point out that great courage was shown by both sides and Goldman must be congratulated for including a scene where a Waffen SS trooper dies in a brave but vain attempt to save his commanding officer who is burning to death . The Waffen SS committed countless atrocities during the war but they were Nazi Germany's elite fighting force also capable of extreme bravery under fire so it's good to see a more balanced view of history , something not seen in more critically aclaimed productions like BAND OF BROTHERS and SAVING PRIVATE RYANIt's a shame A BRIDGE TOO FAR didn't do all that well at the box office or receive the critical acclaim it deserved , but STAR WARS came out at the same time thereby destroying the popularity of historical blockbusters with all star casts . It should also be pointed out that the anti-war sentiments of the film are surpassed by Vietnam movies like APOCALYPSE NOW and PLATOON but how do you make an anti-war film featuring the second world war as a backdrop unless you're a German ? I remember talking to my schoolmates in 1982 after this was shown on TV the previous night and we all agreed at the time this was the best war movie ever made . Looking back now it's not , but it's still a very good account of men in battleFootnote : Check out Ryan's book THE LAST BATTLE , the final - And best - book in the trilogy that tells of the last months of the second world war",

It kept me awake with nightmares as a child, and the library offered no help in locating it until I hit that nice vowel-starting auction site.  In re-watching it, I realized that there are signs of the decade it was created (especially in the bell-bottoms, I couldn't stop laughing when I watched the kids in the band practice their parade because the fashion world has come back to them again!), but there are other nice things. \nOne of the main details that this movie has is no explanations are made. The Indian woman comments about the ill wind that came with the car when she gives testimony.  The sheriff's deputy feels that the reason it can't go into the graveyard is due to the hallowed ground.  (Btw, the graveyard scene is the one that freaked me out as a kid).  Parent (Brolin) discovers there are no handles on the doors, and another witness says that there's no driver.  This all adds up to a nasty scenerio.  Much like the later movie Poltergeist, you have to wonder if the Indians are right--get out of town! (they fled to the Deep Country--smart cookies!)I adore Kim Richards, and her sister Kyle is a darling in this film.  As an adult, I couldn't help but think who would take care of them should something happen to Parent.  I think this is a good sign in a movie--you really begin to identify with the characters when things like this come to you!The comment at the beginning from Anton gives the whole movie's plot a good basis.  I do recommend this as a stay-home, eat popcorn, and enjoy flick!;)**** out of *****",

    "review": "This second film consists mostly of scenes of Benji running. That doesn't have to be a bad thing. The first Benji film consisted mostly of scenes of Benji running, too, but it was quite good. This follow-up isn't as good, but for other reasons.On the positive side, returning writer/director Joe Camp stuck with something unusual that he did in the first film--he did the film from a dog's point of view. That doesn't mean that the film is in first person from Benji's perspective. Imagine more a dog directing. The content, kinds of shots and kinds of angles are mostly what a dog might do. It made the first film, with its very unusual structure, a success, and it more or less makes this one, which also has an unusual structure, well, not exactly a success, but it makes it \"kinda work\".A couple factors bring the success rate down a bit. The story takes place in Greece this time--in a move that seems like maybe the crew and cast wanted a paid vacation in Greece--and a lot of dialogue is in Greek, without subtitles. Although interesting for adults, that's a particularly odd move for a family film, and the goal here is definitely to make a family film--Camp even announces this at the very beginning on screen.Also odd for a family picture, most of the human-sourced interaction in the film features people attacking or chasing Benji--with chloroform, with meat cleavers, with fruit, with a big mean Doberman, and with guns. Not that it's graphic in any way, but the concept is there, and Benji's running is mostly precipitated by unfriendly people chasing him.There is a complex plot involving scientific research, where they want to use Benji for nefarious goals, and where Benji seems to be world-famous, all of which is never explained very well. Heck, most of the dialogue about this is in Greek, although the science-oriented stuff is very sketchily explained in English at the end. Benji being so well-known is never explained.And a final problem--even though the first film was also as if directed by a dog, there were important human characters who had some depth to them. That's not the case here. Benji's owners are hardly in the film and the villains are almost completely non-developed the short amount of time that they're in the film.So we're left primarily with Benji running and running through Greece. Through airports. Through the city streets. Just outside of the city near some ancient ruins. The scenery is nice and nicely shot, Benji does some neat trained actions, and insofar as Camp explores everyday dog stuff, the film is rewarding. Heck, the chased-by-villains scenes are pretty rewarding, too, even if plotwise, you don't know exactly what's going on or why it's going on.This may be the worst Benji film (and I don't know yet, since I'm just rewatching them now after not seeing them for many years), and it may not be a great film for kids for a couple reasons, but it is still very mildly recommendable, especially for fans of Benji films and animal films in general, or for anyone who wants a glimpse of what Greece was like in 1977. It's also amusing to note how much Benji looks like Ron Wood.",

Then a couple of divers go missing and two women are killed in a 'boating accident'; Chief Brody is in charge of the investigation and after the body of a killer whale, complete with bite marks, washes up he is convinced that there is another great white shark in the waters round the island but the town council doesn't believe his claims. Then a group of youngsters, including Brody's sons, go out sailing... inevitably they have a run in with the shark and Chief Brody will have to take to the water again to try to save them.Not surprisingly this isn't as good as the original film; that would have been very difficult. It is however pretty good. There are plenty of scary moments, certainly more than I expected in a UK-PG rated film. It starts well with the divers being killed as they explore the wreck of the Orca, the boat from the first film, and follows that up with an impressive explosion. We then get the chief's fears not being believed which did feel like a bit of a rerun of what happened in the first film. Things get better again when the youngsters sail into danger; the shark may be shown a bit too much and it looks no more realistic than that in 'Jaws' but the young actors do look genuinely terrified which helps make it acceptable. The cast is decent enough although Roy Scheider stands out with his fine performance as Chief Brody. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the original.",

It will no doubt frustrate Hollywood action fan types (unless they've run out of Ambien).\nIt's hard to pinpoint what's wrong with it, it's like a Bergman film without the genius. A Fassbinder film without the daring dialogue. I felt the makers were holding something back, something important.\nAt the beginning, I kind of wanted to step in an talk to the main character (and occasionally to smack him) which says something about how provocative it was.

Ramprasad Sharma (Amol Palekar), a chartered accountant by profession, is a colorful personality who is a sports junkie in the afternoons and an amateur singer in the evenings. With the help of his uncle he lands up a job at a trading firm and embarks on a mission to please his boss Bhavani Shankar (Uttpal Dutt in a hilarious turn) because his whole identity is fake considering his boss disapproves fashion, vehemently opposes the obsession of sports among the youth (although he is a secret sports fan himself), dislikes people who abbreviate their names and use recommendation to get a job, encourages purity of language, and sees mustache as a symbol of pride and a window to the soul. Ramprasad has none of the \"good\" qualities sans the mustache, his only saving grace, which he ends up losing in an attempt to save his skin after being spotted at a Hockey match by his boss. Remembering the plot of a movie an actor friend of his is doing, he manages to convince Bhavani Shankar that it was not him whom he had seen at the stadium but his jobless, good-for-nothing, clean shaven identical twin Laxmanprasad Sharma aka Lucky. So, during the day Ramprasad works as a straight-as-a-reed worker bee quoting quasi intellectual teachings of his imaginary father and in the evening takes on the role of his mustacheless notorious twin brother who teaches music to the boss's daughter and also romances her on the sly.Hrishikesh Mukherjee, once again succeeds in creating a complex story around some simple and some quirky characters like Mrs. Kamala Srivastav (Dina Pathak) \u2013 a reluctant mother for hire and Bade Babu (Yunus Parvez), a not so bright colleague of Ramprasad whose favorite pastime is pulling hair out of his nostrils. He went so far as to mount this broad satire on the platform of Bollywood itself wherein an actor friend of Ramprasad Deven (Deven Varma as himself) mouthpieces the idea that life indeed is stranger than fiction as depicted in the movies and does the humble job of furnishing the fake mustache to the protagonist, the complex results of which sets the whole hanky-panky business into motion.The rest of the cast is mediocre except for Shobha Khote and David in minor roles. Bindiya Goswami as the love interest only shines in her introduction scene and has nothing better to do except look lovelorn. Needless to say, it is the comic timing between Uttpal Dutt and Amol Palekar that is the star of the movie and the two went on to do three more films together with mixed results.",

And the action scene with Jaggu as a butcher trying to hit Amitabh is awesome. I've seen this movie as a 12 years old kid in the Christmas holiday of 1979 and I was impressed by the scene where Zeenat is singing the song 'Do lafzon ki'.

    "review": "When a film is still funny 25 years after it's made, and doesn't feel particularly aged, even a quarter of a century later, then you know that you've struck gold. The famous Monty Python crew once again take a well-known subject and make a lot of fun of it. This time, the subject is religion, or, more specifically, Christianity. Everyone who knows at least a little about Christianity, which is pretty much anyone from the western world, will probably be able to laugh at something in this movie. Unless, of course, you are very Christian yourself, in that case you will probably feel that the film is blasphemous(I don't personally think so, since it makes fun of the followers and the general stupidity of people and organizations back in 30-something A.D., rather than Jesus and his teachings). The plot is about as incoherent as the usual Monty Python team film, though it should be noted that, like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it is an actual film, and not a series of sketches, like, for example, the Meaning of Life. It's about as paced as they usually are, most of the scenes contain a lot of jokes, and then they move on to the next scene, after about five minutes of jokes and sight gags. This is, unfortunately, the problem with their films; if you don't like the jokes, the film might seem extremely slow to you; of course, one could argue that Monty Python mainly make movies for the jokes sake, but they could do better on the pacing, for the sake of viewers who don't like all those repeated jokes. That's not to say that I don't like them, I laugh at them most of the time, heck, I laughed so hard that I almost got stomach ache from it at one particular instant. But, I guess that a lot of people won't like them for this way of making movies. Oh well. You can't please everyone. The humor is great, it's standard Python wacky, crazy humor, so every Python fan should enjoy it. People who don't like Monty Python should give this a chance too, if they have at least a little humor, and they aren't Christian extremists. Christian \"believers\" can probably laugh at it too, like I said, it's not the religion itself, it's more the brainwashed followers that the film makes fun of. All in all, a great film for fans of the Python crew, and people who have a sense of humor about religion(a dark sense of humor, that is). I recommend it to fans of Monty Python, people who enjoy dark humor and people who can laugh a little at the less intelligent parts of Christianity. I fall into all three categories, and I loved it. 8/10",

The scenes with Max and his family had this TV movie vibe thanks to the bizarre choice of music. Also the music at times drowning out the dialogue was very off putting.I did enjoy elements of this film, in particular the set pieces and action parts of this film, despite it being a low budget affair I have to say I was impressed. It's also worth bearing in mind this film was made in the late 1970's so for me that makes the action scenes all that more impressive.Mad Max is a slightly odd low budget action flick that has a certain charm but is let down by down by questionable editing, musical score and acting.",

    "review": "Often while watching this movie I asked myself, How would filmmakers tackle this or that scene today, 25 years later? And while I am certainly not going to applaud 'The Blue Lagoon' as an overlooked masterpiece, CERTAINLY not!, it is still a far cry better than the standard teenage soft-porn that is on offer today.Basically, 'The Blue Lagoon' is about two horny teenagers finding their own path towards sexual fulfillment and adulthood, and it strives to point the way for its multitudes of teenage audiences with some dignity and even fearlessness. Today footage of completely naked infants as well as pre-teens and teens would simply never be realized or even permitted in mainstream OR art cinema, God forbid! Brooke Shields' frank alluding to Christopher Atkins' masturbatory habits could, in a movie today, only be filmed amidst a sea of giggles, whereas in 1980 they did it very deadpan and honestly.The film is full of quite touching scenes and gently, if not exactly marvelously acted. I liked Atkins' prayer that the sick Shields be saved, and he doesn't remember how a prayer goes: \"Our Father who art in Heaven ... Kingdom come ... Liberty and justice for all. Amen\". They don't lead terribly eventful lives on that desert island, but their everyday rituals are beautifully filmed, and the underwater sequences are memorable.",

    "plot": "Cinema legend Martin Scorsese has directed some of the most acclaimed films of all time. See how IMDb users rank all of his feature films as director.",
    "review": "Whoever is dissatisfied by Raging Bull, I'm sure they watched it with expectations of watching a sports movie, like Rocky. Despite the AFI chose Raging Bull as the #1 sports movie of all time, you can't expect to see the most breathtaking boxing match nor to witness the best crochet of boxing history. Raging Bull can only be classified as a drama/biography. Director Scorsese chose to go with black&white cinematography only to keep the young viewers away from this masterpiece of art. It's not fair to compare Rocky with Raging Bull. Rocky was a populist movie mostly for young viewers, and Raging Bull is a cinematic masterpiece. From a wide point of view, for instance, if you look at one of the Michelangelo's paintings; at first you see a nude woman, if you look longer and deeper you realize that her nudity expresses some thought, if you look continuously and give a life to it in your imagination you discover that the women are not just their bodies. Accordingly, like it is not enough looking once to a painting to understand what opinion does it defend; it is not reasonable and not fair to watch Raging Bull so as to see a sports movie. Also it is not reasonable to see Raging Bull only once. Raging Bull is one movie that, every time you watch it you get a better taste, every time you watch it you discover something new. Raging Bull taught us that even if you are the best at some skill, even if you are the best of all; you need to create witnesses, admirers and supporters of your skill. It's the only way to reach the top. Moreover, it is harder to stay at the top than to reach the top. Not because someone better than you can defeat you, it's just because of the need to be accepted on every authority; like the Council of Judges, the Media and the Admiration of People. Director Scorsese draws benefit from the hypocrisy of fame. He empowers Raging Bull to make people ask to their conscience if the popular values that people choose can really cherish their values. In Raging Bull, Jake La Motta was the best boxer of all, but people didn't like him. He was disrespectful, he was uncivilized, he was very ugly, he was arrogant, he was irritable and he didn't care; 'cause he believed himself. Despite the fact that he is the best, everybody disliked him. Soon, he was left alone; and in a very short time he lost everything he possessed. When he opened his eyes back to life, he found himself in prison. The scene that he is punching and butting the wall facing him is one of the most heart rending memorable scenes of the whole cinema history. At the end, he finally throws in the towel of believing himself, he loses his faith and becomes to learn what he never wanted to learn: The Fame. He starts running his own business at a night club under his name, working as a stand-up comedian at the stage. People laugh at him for the jokes he made out of his memories, the jokes paraphrasing the bitter facts of life; including the very famous joke of the British King Richard-III which he said in the year 1485 just before dying: \"A horse, a horse... My kingdom for a horse!\". There we understand truly: For every joke there lies a share of a fact underneath.",

But never enough to make me dislike this film which has so many more truths about human nature & couples. Every one of the cast is good in their roles. Carol Burnett & Alan Alda are perfect together & have one scene in the \"Fall\" section that cracks me up every time. Rita Moreno was truly funny. When her husband, played by Jack Weston, leans out the window on the hotel & shouts, \"She's Italian!\" \"There, now everyone in the state of CT knows that you're Italian.\" Though I've often thought that she had every right to say what led up to this scene, it is still very very funny.I just wish it would come out on DVD.

    "review": "Bill Murray and Harold Ramis join the army and get involved in a plethora of shenanigans.A weak story is saved by the great performances of Murray, Ramis, John Candy, Warren Oats and John Larroquette who are all on madcap top form.There are great scenes prior to enlistment and during basic training. Murray and Ramis are absolutely brilliant in the scene where they sign up. They don't even have to say much more than a few words or just look at each other a certain way and it's hilarious. Also the sequence where John Larroquette sees his platoon for the first time as they charge, screaming through the muddy assault course is fantastic.The film works well in the first two acts, but unfortunately when the focus shifts from basic training to the final sequence it goes down hill quickly. The reason for this is that all the comedic talent is then wasted on a sequence that does not showcase it at all.The humour itself is a product of its time and not something that would see the light of day in the modern age. It is heavy on sexism, there is some racial stereotyping and one character with a learning disorder gets targeted on more than one occasion.This is classic example of irreverent 1980s humour all the way from the Animal House inspired misfit protagonists to the Second City alumni cast. All this tinged with a hint of Cold War propaganda.I loved it as a child in the 80s and it holds up a lot better than other similar films of that era (Caddyshack, Police Academy) on a rewatch in 2020. I do think you have to be fans of Murray, Ramis and Candy and the humour of the time to appreciate it if you are watching it for the first time.",

    "review": "I've liked most of the comedies by the Shashi Kapoor- Amitabh Bachchan duo than the more serious films they did e.g. 'Deewar'. Another title that comes to mind right now is 'Do Aur Do Paanch'. 'Suhaag' too works as a semi-comedy. 'Namak Halaal' provides numerous laughter and entertainment. There is the loyal servant (Bachchan) who's protecting his employer, a hotel owner (Kapoor) because of the promise he made to his mother (Rehman) and he also falls in love with a fellow employee (Patil). There is a grandfather (Prakash) who wants his grandson to make it on his own. There's a siren (Babi) who's been hired to assassinate the hotel owner. Then there's the evil manager (Ranjeet) who wants to frame the mother and kill the owner in order to takeover the hotel.Mehra puts it all together and gives us a thriller/ comedy. This gives Amitabh another chance to show his comedic abilities. The actor does reasonably well at most parts but he does tend to go over the top. Shashi Kapoor is quite adequate. Smita Patil is luminous and Parveen Babi is ravishing. Waheeda Rehman does well with her part as does Om Prakash.The songs are a strong point. Though the first song is better to watch than listen to, the rest are both pleasant for the ears and filmed nicely. Parveen looks particularly stunning in 'Raat Baki' while Smita is sexy in the white sari rain song.'Namak Halaal' is one film that can be enjoyed with the family. It does have its share of flaws as some of the comedy fails to be funny (mostly due to Amitabh's over the top acting).",

    "review": "Rocky III (1982) is definitely tied best Rocky film with IV. It is my third favorite Rocky film. The first one will always be the best. I think the third entry of the franchise is a big improvement over Rocky II in my opinion. He's on top of the world now, bags a statue, and for some reason, Adrian became attractive in this one. Like, REALLY attractive. He got soft, he got arrogant, and he got lazy. He lost his trainer, his title, and most of all, his self-respect to one of the most that makes me angry villains ever to grace the silver screen: Mr. T's Oscar-robbed performance as Clubber Lang and had to regain the 'eye of the tiger' to get it all back in front of the world. This one also proves further that Apollo Creed is human. Guy went from an arrogant prick and sore loser to Rocky's finest ally. Kudos, Carl. I love Mr. T he become famous after this movie there is also Hulk Hogan in it. Adrian in this movie is very supportive and I love Apollo how he was helping Rocky. Rocky III has a heart beside Rocky I.Why I love this film? This is the only Rocky film in which Adrian is well written - to further support my stance that III fires on all cylinders. Really, what purpose does Adrian serve in II, IV and V? She spends most of those movies telling Rocky not to fight - she is not supportive and just a burden to him. In this one, she actually encourages him and is an asset (speach on the beach.) Heck, there wouldn't be much of Rocky II if not for her objections to. It is the best all around Rocky movie. On a literary level (story), entertainment level, filmmaking level, boxing choreography, characters, etc... The fight at the end actually means something for Rocky. He has something to gain from it (unlike V.) This and Rocky I are the ONLY two Rocky movies where Adrian actually encourages Rocky the whole time (unlike II, IV, and V.) Mr. T is perfectly cast. It was so successful because it was the best. Rocky lost everything his manager, his title, his self respect and mostly he lost his edge! Like Apollo said \"Now, when we fought, you had that eye of the tiger, man; the edge! And now you gotta get it back, and the way to get it back is to go back to the beginning.\" That's what I love. When you lose something don't quit. You need gained back the thing you lost. I love how Apollo motivated Rocky in this film and I think Apollo is well written and portrayed in here. I seriously I think Carl Weathers did a wonderful job portraying arrogant Apollo to an awesome Rocky's friend, to a support and ally. I was surprised Apollo was back in the third entry of the Series franchise. I love the training sequences and the music Score by Bill Conti the same score he used in Rocky I, and II. The same year that Sylvester Stallone made Rocky III the same year he went and started in First Blood, his famous role to this days Rambo! Carl Weathers also said that Rocky III is his favorite film he made. Not only that it is the only Rocky sequel film who won another Oscar award, which is the only one. Beside Carl Weathers I think Mr. T was the best actor portraying a villain in this movie I love how he provoked Rocky I really love that. This is the only film the lasted three rounds. The film has two fight with Clubber Lang (Mr. T) and more fights in which Rocky and Clubber are attending too in the opening scene. Rocky fights a wrestler Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) in this film. I also love the music score Eye of the Tiger performed by Survivor! I love this film it is my third best favorite rocky film alongside with Rocky IV. The rating I am giving is 9.5/10, I would have give it 10, I didn't because Mickey dies in this film and that was the most shocking disturbing scene to me. Three years and 10 successful title defenses after beating Apollo Creed, with whom he has become great friends, a now wealthy Rocky Balboa is considering retirement. Fame and complacency soon cause Balboa to lose his title to Clubber Lang, who inadvertently causes the death of Rocky's trainer Mickey. Rocky sinks into a depression, and Apollo decides to train Rocky for a rematch against Lang so Rocky can try to win the title back. That is the basic main plot. Rocky III is a 1982 American film written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone. It is the third installment in the Rocky film series, and the second in the franchise to be directed by Stallone.9.5/10 Grade: A",

In doing so, he is branded a traitor and is hunted by several of Yi Ho's best fighters.I love weapons work in kung fu films and Legendary Weapons of China naturally features lots of it, mostly in the second half; unfortunately, the movie also has rather a lot of comedy (in the first half), something that I always struggle with in kung fu films, making the film as a whole something of a mixed bag for me: desperately unfunny nonsense for the best part of an hour, but ending on a high with plenty of crazy fight action employing the eighteen main weapons of Chinese martial arts: rope dart, double tiger hook swords, double hammers, battle axe, snake halberd, kwan dao, twin broadswords, double-edged sword, Chinese spear, three-section chain whip, double daggers, double crutches, monk's spade, staff, tiger fork, rattan shield, single butterfly sword and three-section staff.Also adding to the fun are the film's sillier weapons, including booby trapped capes and explosive darts, and some really daft moments, best bits being a bonkers fight in the rain and the unforgettable sight of two warriors mutilating themselves, the first poking his own eyes out and the other ripping his goolies off!5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb-not the classic of the genre that I had expected, but entertaining enough.",

    "review": "'Five Element Ninjas (1982)' is a Kung fu flick about a martial arts school whose best fighters win a tournament and, in the process, cause a Japanese opponent to commit Seppuku. The man's fellow fighters send a letter to one of his allies back in Japan, an ally who just so happens to be a master ninja and leader of the eponymous five element ninja clans. Naturally, the ninjas make their way to China to avenge their fallen friend, and their mysterious martial arts skills prove to be very challenging to overcome. That's the basic set-up, even if the synopsis spoils a lot more of the narrative, and what follows is a nuts-and-bolts - but no less effective for it - revenge thriller with sequences of sometimes startlingly brutal combat and an unexpectedly nihilistic vibe. The five element ninja factions all use different methods to defeat their foes. For example, the gold ninjas use copper (?) hats to blind their opponents, the wood ninjas disguise themselves as trees, the water ninjas hide (you guessed it) underwater, the fire ninjas cloud the battlefield with smoke before striking with flaming swords, and the earth ninjas attack from beneath the ground. Each clan has several more tricks up its sleeve, but their common theme is to surprise and disorient their opponents before they viciously carve them to pieces. There are also regular ninjas who can silently infiltrate even the most heavily guarded of places, and they strike with ruthless efficiency using claws and iron fists and daggers and all manner of deadly instruments. They aren't interested in fighting fair and it's this that gives them their greatest advantage over the more traditional Chinese martial artists comprising the film's heroic side. Even though it is essentially a China vs Japan affair and there is an undercurrent of Ninjutsu being less honorable than Kung fu, the flick doesn't really feel interested in the kind of jingoism so often present in its peers (some martial arts movies are literally anti-Japanese propaganda pieces). It isn't really interested in the political implications of its premise, more so in pitting two different styles of combat against each other and making a broad but indicting statement about vengeance - and even violence - in general (one of the characters, after murdering someone who has recently wronged them, says to himself: \"I didn't do anything wrong... did I?\"). It's arguably uninterested in making any kind of statement at all, but its unwillingness to compromise on its focal violence speaks volumes in itself. This is sometimes downright nasty and it has no semblance of mercy to it. It also has a fairly unusual pacing that puts a lot of emphasis on the things building up to the hero's desire for revenge, rather than on the training process required to achieve it (which still appears but is much shorter so that the following segment can surprise us with the techniques the lead has learned in order to counter the various strategies of the five element ninjas). After a pretty full-on opening movement, the picture slows down significantly to introduce and focus on a kind of femme fatale character, and this somewhat humdrum segment is clearly the weakest. It's narratively important, but ever-so-slightly dull. It doesn't help that the soundtrack features an incredibly repetitive motif that builds and reaches its crescendo literally on a loop as if it's emphasising several major reveals that all occur within minutes of one another. In reality it's used to highlight things like opening a window or delivering a note, and its overused so much that it's genuinely annoying. Despite these issues, though, the film is a lot of fun when it gets out of its own way and does what it's best at: highly choreographed ultraviolence. With a colourful, almost cartoony aesthetic and a willful shunning of reality (it makes excellent use of reversed footage), the movie depicts its impressive combat as frantic, urgent and splattered with blood. Although it still tends to seem more like a painful dance than a duel (not a complaint), the film is considerably more vicious than a lot of its peers and is unafraid to showcase its brutality in shades of gleefully saturated red. People are stabbed, slashed, disemboweled and literally pulled apart, and it's all glorious. It's all in good fun (for us) and makes for some really memorable set-pieces soaked in bodily fluids and punctuated by out-of-place smiles of victory. Overall, this is a highly enjoyable and suitably silly martial arts movie that features some notable moments of gore and a strangely bleak atmosphere that's actually slightly haunting in retrospect. It's good stuff.",

    "review": "Mandi is without a doubt one of the most entertaining movies of the great Shyam Benegal. Through this film, Benegal presents the world of young prostitutes and their madame, all of whom reside in an old brothel in Hyderabad. But unlike the glamorous portrayal of courtesans which are so common in Hindi movies, here we see an authentic and realistic depiction of the routine and effervescent neighbourhood and the brothel in particular. Benegal perfectly captures the atmosphere of the people residing in the village and his portrayal of their lifestyle is very impressive.Mandi explores the hypocrisy of the society, but it's not as much a social movie as it is a satirical comedy. This is one of Benegal's most enjoyable movies in this regard. The film includes so many hilarious moments, keeping the audience entertained and yet never losing its seriousness. The humour comes in equal parts from the superb witty dialogues, the lifelike situations, the colourful characters, and the dark, ironic mood of the film, in which a serene but humorous narrative presents serious issues and flavours them with great sarcasm. That's what makes the film the more so amusing and funny.One of the reasons Mandi works is the collaborative work of the ensemble cast, which includes some of the most talented actors in India, all of whom understand the film's darkly comic tone and act accordingly. Unquestionably, it is Shabana Azmi who leads the film as Rukmini, the domineering but caring madame of the house. At 33, Azmi plays a woman much ahead of her years, and she delivers an incredibly convincing and colourful portrayal, which is unrestrained and subtle at the same time. In preparation for the role, Azmi put on weight, and despite looking young, she definitely looks the part. Her unusually loud tone and crudely unrefined mannerisms are masterfully done, and it's both amazing and amusing to see her switching moods from angry to happy to suffering to motherly and loving. This is one of her most entertaining performances.The rest of the cast is there to support Azmi, with Smita Patil and Naseeruddin Shah acquiring top honours. Patil is wonderful as the young and gentle Zeenat, who is also Rukmini's most beloved girl in the brothel, whom she has treated like her own daughter and for whom she cares the most. Shah delivers a greatly ambiguous performance as Rukmini's loyal employee, who indulges in funny and diverting emotional outbursts when she is not nearby. Kulbhushan Kharbanda is very good as the sophisticated businessman. Saeed Jaffrey is hilarious as Agarwal, who shares a common secret with Rukmini. Om Puri, Amrish Puri, and Pankaj Kapur lend adequate support in smaller parts, and so does the entire group of the brothel's girls, which includes such famous names as Ila Arun, Anita Kanwar, Ratna Pathak, Neena Gupta and Soni Razdan.Mandi has music composed by Vanraj Bhatia, a regular in Benegal films. There are very few songs, but they are all nice. Mandi is a highly watchable movie. My favourite scenes are those taking place in Zeenat's room when several men come to visit her, much to Rukmini's displeasure. I loved the film's ending. Despite leaving several questions unanswered, it shows that there always is a ray of hope in everything. One of Shyam Benegal's most unusually crafted works, a great film with dark humour (which is so missing in Indian movies) and fantastic performances, which deserves many repeat viewings.",

Every announcer says things like, \"Bottom of the third, men on first and third, Turley on the mound, Simpson is up, he's two for four today. The wind is blowing out to right field, etc.\" We can make words visual. In this wonderful movie, a man wants a piece of that tradition. He makes a horrible mistake along the way to the big leagues, and now is given one last chance. This is mythical. This is not realistic. To criticize it on the basis of its credibility is unfair. Even to compare it to the book is unfair. They are totally different. What one does with a camera should not be compared to the printed page. Malamud did his thing and now Barry Levinson is doing his. The cinematography is without peer. It is magical all the way through. The lighting as Glenn Close stands up in the stands is mesmerizing. This is more Greek myth than baseball story, but it is a baseball story, with the Ruth like gods and the day-to-day players. Roy Hobbs is like all of us in some ways and we love him for his endurance, patience, and drive. Redford brings him to life with that rugged face moving away from lost youth. It's a fine film.",

Director Sergio Leone and editor Nino Baragli trimmed the footage to around six hours, with the plan of releasing the film as two three-hour movies. The producers refused this idea, and Leone had to further cut the film down to three hours and forty-nine minutes.",
    "review": "This is, for me, one of the finest examples of cinematic art. It isn't a simple, cut-n-dried 90 minute little package that gets wrapped up with a pretty bow at the end. You get pulled in by the enigmatic opening that unwinds the threads of the story to be found later. For many people having half an hour of purely visual story telling, of stories that are only mysteries at that point, before anything becomes truly linear is difficult to follow and discourages to many people. Our own memories are only snippets that only become linear as we concentrate on scenes from our lives. Once Upon a Time in America is like that as we follow Noodles through the `significant' part of his life - the times that formed him. When the story actually starts, we meet the girl that he always loved but could never have.David `Noodles' Aaronson (DeNiro) was a kid on the very mean streets of Brooklyn when organized crime was born in America and he grew into and out of it. That's the simplest synopsis of the plot. The reality is that this isn't a movie about gangsters. Being a gangster is the easiest way for Noodles to survive and get ahead, but it also alienates and ruins his one love. Whenever he is close to giving himself to Deborah he always gets pulled back into the gang, in some form or another.DeNiro's portrayal is of a gangster, through and through, who also has a conscience that, while not preventing him from being a ruthless killer, rules his life with regret, remorse and guilt. Leone takes a bit of poet/historic license by showing the Brooklyn Bridge being built in the background (the bridge had been built 40 years before), but it symbolizes Noodles' own growth. When the bridge is just pilings and incomplete towers, Noodles is just forming his future. By the time the bridge is complete, Noodles is nothing but a gangster and the bridge is majestic. When he returns 35 years later our view of the bridge is from under a freeway -- the world has moved along, but the bridge and Noodles are just as they were.The length: If you're looking for a brief distraction that you'll barely remember 30 minutes later, this isn't the movie for you. However, if you are prepared and able to be undistributed for the nearly 4 hours that this film uses to compress a lifetime -- you will be rewarded with many facets of thought and examination.",

I watched a large part of it tonight on TBS, and while watching, I tried to recall my initial thoughts when I saw it as a youth.I do remember liking it as a teenager, though I also remember that I did find the premise a bit hard to swallow. (America placed in such a vulnerable position and without any real allies? And being overrun so quickly?) Still, there WAS still a threat of some kind between the two superpowers. Seeing people my age forced to flee, and then fight back for their freedom was something I'd never seen before - usually teenagers were characters in sex comedies. I suppose that's why this movie stuck so much in my mind, and I'd imagine myself in such a situation, fighting and killing those damned bloodthirsty commies!Seeing the movie again was very interesting. The action scenes are still good, the movie travels at a swift pace, the cinematography is impressive. I also saw signs that writer/director Milius, though right-wing in real life, wasn't taking everything seriously here. Witness the scene where a tank pulls up to a small gas station and we hear \"ding-ding!\"While watching, though, I was struck by my change of viewing, due to the end of the cold war. Did I really feel any kind of fear or threat? Of course, times are different now.

    "review": "Ok, lets just get this out the way, Michael Pare as an actor really sucks. Now I know that to most that isn't like earth shattering news but I just wanted to point that out because he is the worse part about this movie. Some would say that this whole movie sucks but not me. I just love this movie. How this movie tanked when it came out is understandable, it had a feel and look that was out of step with the times which really blows because this movie just rocks.Lets start out with what its all about. So we have a singer named Ellen Aim(played by Diane Lane) who is kidnaped by a gang lead by Willem Dafoe. Out to rescue Aim is one Tom Cody(played by our friend Pare). Along for the ride is Rick Moranis and Amy Madigan. Great cast right? The music kicks ass, the 50's mashup with the 80's adds a style that is unquestionably different. It's all pretty much silly fun that at times is so over the top that it's hard to keep a straight face. But i gotta keep going to the look because you are not going to find any other movie like it anywhere.It really bothers me that this movie isn't better liked or remembered by so many. It's everything that the 1980's were, over the top and crazy. Mix in the action of Walter Hill as director and it's such a fun time.I could go on and on about by the bad dialogue and bad jokes that sit alongside black leather gangs like they were made for each other. I could tell you about a lot of things but every time I watch this movie my big question always comes back. Why did it bomb. It bomb because our hero is awful. I want to always love this movie more then it should but Pare and his bad acting always gets in the way.So should you see this movie? Yes, just pretend that anyone but Pare is our hero",

    "review": "On paper, the premise for Disciples of the 36th Chamber probably sounded promising, sadly this is a disappointing finale to the 36th Chamber trilogy. There's little of the inventiveness and vitality that figured so heavily in the previous films, instead, we're given a sub-standard kung-fu revenge plot tinged with the occasional comedic beats. It feels like a product of yesteryear, marking the passing of the torch when it comes to populist Hong Kong action cinema. One that relegates Gordon Liu to a mere supporting role and focuses on the most annoying Fong Sai-Yuk in the history of Hong Kong cinema as played by Hsiao Ho. That being said, Lau Kar-Leung's direction remains particularly strong but it's his script where the film falls apart, with a few tweaks here and there, it could have been a winner. The usual production values that so epitomise a Shaw Brothers production are all here but ultimately it's at the expense of awfully sluggish pacing, this is the shortest film of the trilogy and yet it feels the longest to the point at which I felt I was zoning out. Sadly, there's not a lot to distinguish Disciples of the 36th Chamber as its own unique experience. It feels tired and stagnant, even with all its traditional Shaw Brothers style, signifying a changing tide for audiences.",

Action takes place in Sopot, where Wagner is some kind of fortuneteller and his sister is a medium. They detect the presence of a few people which are guided by insanely powerful medium. Those people meet in Sopot (where there is famous Polish pier shown later) but while controlled they are unaware what they did or what they were doing in that location. Later, an investigation carried out by detective and his deputy that sworn his loyalty to Nazis, results in conclusion that this is repetition of a cycle in which... The movie is accompanied by excellent music which enhances the atmosphere of the mystery. Interestingly, casual dialogues are without any background music. In addition to that we got some historical background when Hitler started to rule in Germany along with the party of the Nazis (NSDAP). To summarize, we receive a very original Polish production, however it will be difficult to examine for those who don't like movies concerning psychological things rather than gore and action.

    "plot": "Sylvester Stallone decided that for the shooting of the fight, he and Dolph Lundgren should hit one another for real, so as to increase the intensity of the scene. After doing three takes of Rocky taking shots to ribs, Stallone felt a burning in his chest, but ignored it. Later that night, he had difficulty breathing and was taken to a nearby emergency room. It was discovered that his blood pressure was over 200, and he had to be flown on a low-altitude flight from Vancouver, Canada to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, where he remained in intensive care for four days. What had happened was that Lundgren had punched him so hard in the chest, Stallone's heart had slammed up against his breastbone and began to swell, cutting off the blood supply and restricting the oxygen flow throughout the body. . However, when asked about whether or not it really happened while answering a series of fan questions in a 2021 interview with the Guardian, Lundgren claimed to have no recollection of the incident. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"[Stallone] keeps talking about it, so maybe he's right. He did go to the hospital, but I don't know whether it was my punches or the fact that he was so overworked as the director, actor and writer. We shot those 15 rounds over two or three weeks, eight or 12 hours a day, so you're throwing thousands of punches. If you don't connect, it looks a bit fake, but it doesn't mean you want to hurt the other guy. But there were no hard feelings.\" He went on to explain that stand-ins and stunt doubles were rarely used, and that he has performed the majority of his own stunts and fight scenes--but that this has changed in more recent years. \"Back in the day, you had to do it all yourself: Rocky IV, The Punisher, Masters of the Universe, all the Expendables,\" he said. \"I've jumped from a motorcycle to a truck; dangerous things I would never do now. Staying physically fit over the years has been nice. There aren't many actors who can stay physically fit for a long time. Part of the game is trying to look fit, at least.\"",
    "review": "Rocky IV really stood out from the rest of the Rocky films to me, with the whole America versus Russia ordeal. Now it has been mentioned by other critics that this is inaccurate, but who really cares??? The point is that you really get to the point where you want Sly to kick Dragos butt in the ring. I enjoyed the training montage, and the boxing scene was so entertaining for me. And with the Russian leaders, and the Russian public standing up and cheering and clapping for Rocko.. a bit corny but so great.Talia shire in my opinion is at her best in this one out of all the other ones; she seems more confident and easier to get along with her character. And one of the most dramatic scenes to hit cinema was the death of Carl Weathers(Apollo Creed). The idea of fighting for the death of his friend, and for himself is just so inspirational. It just makes you want to jump up and get in the ring to help rocko. Out of a perfect score of 10, i gave this one a 7.",

The movie is thin sliced narrative with multiple plots working together on the wholesome theme.

    "review": "First of all let me say that this movie is genuinely, ingeniously funny, the watch-it-twelve-times-and-it-never-gets-old kind of movie. I myself have seen it seven and a half times and will probably view it again before the end of summer. The movie stars then 23-year-old Matthew Broderick as 17-year-old Ferris Bueller, a high school student who would like nothing better than to be done with school. So he gives in to a strong temptation to cut class and go to downtown Chicago with friends Cameron and girlfriend Sloane (who he gets out of school extremely cleverly, and quite hilariously i might add!). It doesn't take long for principal Edward Rooney to catch on to Ferris's skipping, so he tries as hard as he can to catch him, but is going on about it quite unsuccessfully. All through the movie we learn of Cameron's struggles with his parents and life itself, and through all the hilarity of the movie Cameron finds a part of himself that he hadn't been able to find before. The movie consists of several several fun scenes, such as the German American Appreciation Day Parade, in which Ferris climbs onto the Great Float and the parade-goers dance to \"Danke Schoen\" by Wayne Newton and \"TWIST AND SHOUT\" of course, by the Beatles. Other very important characters are Jeanie Bueller, his revenge-seeking sister who can't seem to understand why Ferris gets away with everything, and Grace, the absent-minded and honest-to-a-fault secretary. There are so many left out parts and characters but to see them all you'll have to watch the movie (you won't regret it!). \"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\" -ferris bueller I give this movie 2 thumbs up, if only i had more hands i could give it a higher rating....",

Although set in Okinawa , the film was actually shot in Oahu , Hawaii . The island was chosen because of its similar climate to Japan, its large Okinawan population and the convenience of filming on US soil . Again the movie develops a feeling and agreeable friendship between Daniel and professor Miyagi . Attractive and perceptible performances from Macchio , Morita and Tamlyn Tomita's film debut. Besides , it appears as very secondaries and uncredited , future TV stars , as B.D. Wong (Law and order) and Clarence Gilyard (Walker Texas Ranger).Colorful cinematography by James Crabe and powerful musical score by Bill Conti , usual of trilogy . The motion picture was professionally directed by John G Avildsen (also editor) . Avildsen has blended more Karate Kid and Rocky movies with such feel-good message stories , such as 'Power on one' and 'Lean on me' . It's followed by other sequels, 'Karate kid III' (1989) where Daniel again fighting his usual contenders ; and 'The next Karate Kid' (1994) directed by Christopher Cain , introducing a new Karate kid , girl , the two times Oscarized Hilary Swank .

In fact there are no scenes shot in HK at all. Nearly everything is on location in Mainland China. It's also the last Liu Chia Liang film working with his Shaw crew of cameramen and technicians. It's one of the first HK and Mainland co-productions and the first time Jet Li worked with anyone other than Mainland film crews. Jet Li has been unusually frank about his unhappiness with the work habits of the HK crew, director Liu included.The story is clearly from HK as Jet Li gets into situations that would have been considered unacceptable in a Mainland production at that time. He plays a mischievous kung fu monk with an agenda for revenge against an evil warlord. He meets up with a girl with the same agenda but she's disguised as a boy which fools everyone but the audience. Many, many fight scenes with a generous helping of lion dancing.The film is thematically the style of Liu's previous films for the Shaw studios right down to the woman dressed as a man plot device. If the story was a little bit more substantial perhaps this film would be as well known as Liu's other classics. It's easy to imagine replacing the entire Mainland acting company with the Shaw regulars. The camera work is in the Shaw style but with the added benefit of gorgeous Mainland landscapes and famous landmarks. The action is classic Liu Chia Liang choreography with a Mainland Wu Shu twist. The mass action scenes are exceptional. Great action, Jet Li playing a comic character, excellent photography. Recommended.",

If you go back and watch Richard Pryor's \"live in Concert\" or \"Here and Now\" you see that Eddie used some of Pryor's stuff, but gave it its own shot of himself (In delirious, Murphy does the \"bARBQ scene/story\" and he describes his aunt falling down the steps. It is the exact same description Pryor does in \"Live in Concert\" when he describes black women at funerals.) RAW used all the things that made Eddie Murphy famous; his deadon imitations, and his gift for telling stories. I can't even watch Martin Lawrence, DL Hughely, Cedric the Entertainer and a few others without noticing Eddie Murphy's influences right away. People forget how big he was, and how good- wayyy before he started doing bad talking animal movies. There are some debates over which was better Raw or Delirious....they are both hilarious, but you can tell the mindset was much different only 4 years later. In RAW, Murphy compares himself to Johnny Carson, while in Delirious he was just the most popular guy on Saturday Night Live. RAW is one of the best and funniest concert comedies ever, and I dare someone not to laugh out loud when watching it......NOTE: This movie was reviewed in 1987 when it came out by Siskel and Ebert \"AT The Movies\", which was when they were getting really popular in syndication, and it spurred one of the best on-air disagreements between the two EVER. Siskel likened RAW, and Eddie Murphy overall, as being as funny (or funnier)and outrageous as Pryor, Carlin or Lenny Bruce. He loved the movie. Ebert despised it, and chastised Siskel for being \"immature\" and he also felt that Murphy's attitudes toward women were patronizing, damaging and even went so far as to call RAW a \"pale imitation of a good comedienne\". I thought Ebert was nuts at the time, and now that Siskel is dead, I can't find any review of RAW on Ebert's website. I've emailed him numerous times about it, trying to figure out why a movie that was so popular, and not even that long ago, would not be in his database. Does anyone else thinks that sounds fishy?",

In the cinemas, Chuck Norris was Missing In Action, Rambo asked 'Do we get to win this time?', Tom Cruise was Born on the Fourth of July, Robin Williams was screeching 'Good Morning', Michael J. Fox suffered the Casualties of War, and Kubrick's jacket was of the full metal variety. Oliver Stone's Vietnam film Platoon even cleaned up at the Oscars, winning four awards, including Best Picture.It's understandable that Hamburger Hill, with its cast of relative unknowns and second-tier director, didn't receive quite as much attention as the aforementioned heavy-hitters, but if you're serious about war movies, don't let the lack of any big names put you off: the film is just as worthy of praise as Platoon, if not more-so, the green cast only adding to the film's already palpable authenticity. Shot in the thick jungles and even thicker mud of the Phillipines, the film tells of one of the most costly battles of the Vietnam War, the fight for Hill 937 in the Ashau Valley, known to grunts as Hamburger Hill. Director John Irvin's aim is to capture the horrors of war in all their bloody detail, and the sense of realism he achieves is remarkable: when his characters die, they don't throw their arms up in slow motion to the strains of Adagio for Strings\u0085 they do so in a sudden welter of gore, hammering home the notion that war is hell.By the end of Hamburger Hill, the viewer is left as emotionally drained as its surviving characters are physically exhausted.",

    "review": "Jaws: The Revenge is the final entry into the Jaws series, and thank God for that. Ellen Brody is now living in the Bahamas after her youngest son Sean, who has followed in the footsteps of his father and become Chief of the Amity police, is killed by another Great White Shark. In what is the most ridiculous plots of all time, we find out that one specific shark is holding a grudge against the Brody family, and after it kills Sean, it swims against the Gulf Stream down to the Bahamas so it can kill Ellen and Michael as well. Jaws: The Revenge is an embarrassment to anyone who knows anything about sharks, and is the worst of the series.The plot is completely wrong in this movie. The whole plot is built off of bs. I can't even allow suspension of disbelief to let me ignore that the shark is hunting the Brody family. It's ridiculous! Aside from that is that the film contains any number of factual errors about sharks ranging from having the shark swim backwards, roar like a lion, stand on its tail, and devour a helicopter. The shark in the first film did unusual things, but nothing that would make a shark lover cry.The acting in this movie is so bad that...You know what? I don't even want to discuss it. It's bad. Terrible. Loathsome. Repugnant. What else is there? Lorraine Gray played Ellen just fine in the first film, but for some reason in this film she let all of her acting skill slip away. Even Michael Caine, who is a vastly talented actor, shows absolutely no skill at all.Every copy of Jaws: The Revenge should be swallowed by the shark from the first film.1/10",

    "review": "I must say I am very disappointed in the people slamming this movie.  While they are certainly entitled to their opinion, I think if they watched the movie again without an open mind, they would come to love it as I have.I can't even begin to describe the pure quality of this movie.  Absorbing story, believable, sympathetic characters, pathos, bathos, all the makings of a thought-provoking movie. Personally, there are two quintessential rock and roll movies:  \"The Doors,\" and \"La Bamba.\"For a good cry and a good time, check out this movie.  You don't even have to be a fan of Valens or a fan of 50's music to fall in love with it.",

    "review": "This movie starts out pretty slow with a killer named Charles Lee Ray doing voodoo magic to put his soul into a kid's doll. After that it starts to get slow and generic even with the killer doll with things not making much sense (and I am not talking about the Chucky doll thing either). But when Chucky starts his sinister cacklying and cursing that he is known for the movie does pick up. The build up to that point isn't that bad though and I can understand why they had to go in that direction at first. It does add a sense of mystery even if the audiences does know what is going on from the start. The trademark Chucky voice really does add flavor to this slasher. As a matter of fact I wouldn't be shocked if Heath Ledger was inspired by Chucky for his role in \"The Dark Knight\" now that I think about it. It's cool to see Chucky not going on that unstoppable killer slasher direction, he uses stealth and pulls tricks to kill someone. Plus whenever found, he could just act like a regular doll. Which actually does adds to making him quite a dangerous and sinister killer. This does not have a lot of blood and gore, nor does it have a lot of body count but it does have entertainment value for a horror slasher movie. Overall this is a slasher movie that had a lot of cool and new elements to work with when it came to the direction at the time. And it's understandable how Chucky became one of the most memorable killer villain from the 80's. Thanks to Brad Dourif signature voice as Chucky.8/10",

    "review": "Seriously deranged stuff with a ridiculous premise of alien clowns setting up camp near a small town, abducting the local inhabitants and turning them into cotton candy and snacks. Any film with a title like this deserves this amount of attention and it's still a stellar cult favorite in the Midnight- and Bad Movie circuits. Most of the films intentionally made as bad movies or camp usually blow it (like most of Troma's disasters), but this is a surprisingly fun and good-natured homage to some silly sci-fi and horror classics of the fifties like FORBIDDEN PLANET (1956), INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956) and THE BLOB (1958).Our heroes are Debbie and Dave, two of your typical annoying eighties' youngsters with bad hairdos and less than impressive acting skills, trying to persuade the locals something's seriously wrong here. \"Nobody stores Cotton Candy like this\", observes Debbie when they enter the alien Klowns' circus tent. Smart girl, but how to get rid of these cosmic bozos. Now, clowns are plain creepy and evil. We all know that. Although the tone is generally tongue-in-cheek, the film does manage to throw in some genuine scares. The make-up fx are very impressive and when these Klowns are on the rampage, they are a seriously scary bunch. Undeniably a campy affair, with its truly off-the-wall premise, cheezy acting and predictable storyline, the whole film is laden with an irresistible charm, nicely complemented with a catchy theme song by cult punk band The Dickies, so eighties and so dated, it was already seriously out of fashion by the time the film was released. Cheezy fun all the way.Camera Obscura --- 7/10",

The film is full of tense and exciting moments of action and humour from both De Niro and Grodin who in this film I think are both at the top of their game. Their chemistry in playing hard ass bounty hunter and sensitive criminal is fantastic. It is such a shame there was no talk of a sequel in mind, especially since it is such an original and cool story and we were gagging to see De Niro return as Jack Walsh again. The film also gives us an impressing supporting cast with Dennis Farina (Snatch, Get Shorty) as an angry mobster and Yaphet Kotto (Alien)as an angry cop on the trail for them both.An easy 10/10.

After the movie came out, the real Mystic Pizza shop became so popular, lines would stretch to the sidewalk and patrons would regularly steal mementos from the restaurant.",
    "review": "This \"sleeper\" hit looks just as good today as it did when it was first released. It follows the trials and tribulations of three childhood friends. They all work as waitresses in a pizza parlor and all are at a crossroad in their life. Kat (Annabeth Gish) is preparing to leave home for Yale to begin a career in Astronomy. Daisey (Julia Roberts) Kat's sister, seems to be floundering, with no real direction to go in life, and JoJo (Lili Taylor, who gives the film's most comedic performance), is torn between her love for her fianc\u00e9 Bill, and settling down into a married life filled with screaming kids and massive weight gain.The film integrates all three stories and keeps the plot moving at a brisk pace. All three friends have very different personalities, allowing most of the audience to be able to identify with at least one of them. I will admit, however, that the ultra idealistic, goodie-goodie Kat does get on my nerves from time to time. (I particularly enjoyed the scene where Daisey hauls off and belts her across the face). The chemistry between the leads works extremely well which only strengthens the movie. Roberts gives a strong performance and shows the audience the first signs of the Hollywood powerhouse she would soon become. The three leads are admirabley backed up by a strong supporting cast as well, most notably, Conchata Ferrell as the owner of the pizza parlor. All in all, a very sweet movie about real people and real family situations, and it remains one of my favorite movies of all time. I literally never tire of this modern classic. My only quibble is that the last spoken line is disturbingly unimaginative and anti-climactic. After crafting such a superb screenplay, the writers just seemed to run out of inspiration at the last hurdle. As Mr. Spock would say, \"Fascinating.\" Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",

    "review": "While I haven't seen every episode (compared to the other Mario cartoons) and also the Legend of Zelda segments, I still think that the show is good. The show was split into two, a live action part with guest stars from the era (the 80s) and the cartoon. I didn't mind and even liked some of the live action parts with goofy Lou Albano and Danny Wells as Mario & Luigi but I enjoyed the cartoon better. There are parodies of film, books and legends in the show, but I only seen some of the parody episodes but I liked them but not as much as the earlier produced episodes which give a vintage charm due to better plotting.I don't know why, but I find this series better animated than the next 2 Mario cartoons due to less colouring goofs and better voice acting, especially from Princess Toadstool (compared with SMB3 and Super Mario World) and the Mario Brothers sound more courageous (even Luigi, believe or not) which also introduced their Brooklyn accent. Even Mouser in the show has a good Pseudo German accent and character as well as King Koopa, my favourite character due to his lines and actions however he looks different compared to the games. During an episode, there would be a music track in the background that are covers from real bands and singers like Michael Jackson's Bad or Proud Mary. It is a shame that the US DVD releases have these omitted, while it doesn't make much difference in Super Mario Bros. 3 (except the Milli Vanilli episode) this is like a huge difference in mood and setting. I even compared King Mario of Cramelot US when it was aired on Yahooligans with the UK DVD which has the original music and I found the UK one more enjoyable with the Mario and King Koopa scenes, the US one was far less exciting, however it still had the remixed soundtrack of the Mario games as well in all episodes. One thing that's legendary is Do The Mario which still shows the test of time and is quite fun to dance to for the kids.This is probably the best Mario cartoon since it started it all and is such a timeless classic that you should buy it or if it is aired somewhere, watch it.",

    "review": "Ever had a feature film where you really don't know how to feel about it? You don't hate it by any means, but you also don't really love it all that much either? For me, it's Don Bluth's All Dogs go to Heaven. Noted to be the first Don Bluth feature made after his brief stint with Steven Spielberg (which got him to beat Disney at their own game), the film was practically slaughtered on its original release by The Little Mermaid, although it did gain a massive cult following on home video. In spite of that however, many critics of Bluth's work have stated this marked the beginning of his dark period, and even I can see why.The film tells the story of Charlie B. Barkin, a casino gambling German Shepherd who gets murdered by his former partner, Carface Carruthers, but leaves Heaven to go to Earth with a rewindable watch. On Earth, he and his best friend, Itchy Itchiford, get back at Carface by using a young orphan girl named Anne-Marie, who teaches them an important lesson about kindness, friendship and love. What sounds convoluted plot-wise is even more muddled in the execution, as the film goes from an inner world in New Orleans with dogs who plot and scheme one-another to then having this orphan child come in out of left field. Throughout the feature, the initial goal of Charlie getting back at his foe feels almost sidelined to focus more on Anne-Marie, as if the filmmakers couldn't make up their minds on how to drive the narrative forward. What's even more frustrating is that both archs work well on their own: the revenge angle presents some fun concepts in this world where dogs coincide on their own and Anne-Marie's presence helps provide the feature with a good amount of heart and emotions. It's just unfortunate that the jumbled tone on deciding whether it wants to be serious or light hearted got in the way of a cohesive story.Now in terms of characters, Charlie himself comes off more unlikable than the film may have intended. Even when he learns about the meaning of kindness, his actions towards Anne-Marie feel undeserved and rather petty. Yes he's meant to be the wise cracking con artist with a heart of gold, but there are times when his bitterness to others is more mean spirited than necessary. Meanwhile, Itchy is a charming albeit neurotic comedic relief, Carface and Killer are the generic smart and dumb villain types, and anyone else. If any credit must be given to the voice actors, Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise make a great duo as Charlie and Itchy, as their improvisational banter and sardonic remarks are more entertainmenting than most of what goes on in the feature. Also, in spite of this being the last film for child actress Judith Barsi, the sincerity she gave in her performance as Anne-Marie feels like that of a genuinely innocent child who understands right and wrong and wants someone who will love and care for her. I guess for every mangy trait, these characters do have some good in them after all.Of course, being a Don Bluth film, you're going to have gorgeous visuals, although here it comes with a mixed bag. On one hand, it's cool to have the dogs look and act in a more exaggerated and cartoony manner than the more realistic humans presented, but at times the animals look so exaggerated to the point of looking unappealing and they can't decide whether they want to walk on all fours or be anthropomorphic. Alternatively, the backgrounds are rich in detail, color and atmosphere, whether they be the gorgeous Louisiana landscapes, the surreal dreamlike heaven and hell, or even the abstract multicolor environments with strange creatures (like one such alligator). Also, there are some really bizarre edits in this film, as in you'll get a key shot of a sequence and then it will go away to another shot that will last less than five seconds (seriously, blink and you'll miss some stuff). Lastly, the musical numbers are what I like to call entertaining show stoppers, because as upbeat and catchy as they can be, most of them stop the story dead in its tracks and could have been cut out altogether.So in the end, All Dogs remains a well intentioned albeit disjointed and somewhat jumbled hodgepodge with a mix of positives and negatives. For every intriguing and freshly new concept, luscious animation, likable character and fun filled song, there's a competing sub plot, bad archetype, questionable filmmaking choice and weak execution that makes the experience feel all over the place. I do recommend this film to a family audience and especially Don Bluth fans, because as scattered as the film feels in its presence, it does offer at least some stuff for people to get acquainted with, whether unintentionally or not.",

    "review": "Jack Lemmon is magnificent in this touching family drama from television creator Gary David Goldberg (Family Ties) about an overworked son, (Danson) not having seen his father (Lemmon) for over two years, is shocked to discover how deteriorated his father has become under the over-protective eye of his mother (Dukakis). Lovely musical score provided by James Horner.",

    "plot": "During the 1990 Oscar ceremony, while announcing the Best Picture nominees, Kim Basinger caused some controversy when she ignored her scripted text and said: \"We've got five great films here, and they're great for one reason: because they tell the truth. But there is one film missing from this list, that deserves to be on it, because ironically, it might tell the biggest truth of all, and that's Do the Right Thing (1989).\" Spike Lee would later thank her for it in a 2019 episode of the podcast \"Unspooled\".",
    "review": "A scorching summer day brings racial tensions to their boiling point in a Brooklyn neighborhood. Seen through many points of view Spike Lee paints a convincing and critical picture of tensions in the most diverse city in the USA.The film's strength is its ability to ring true to many sets of ears and especially if you frequent or live in a big city. You always here of events - big and small - on the news and there is usually that element of \"racial tensions\" or \"possible racial motive.\" In a city where over 200 different languages are spoken (which can give you an idea of how many distinguishable cultures there are) it is only a natural ingredient for friction between people. Whether you hate the other guy, or are just annoyed that you can't understand him nor he you, when all you want to do is buy some groceries. This film shows many situations of this type and how everyone is, in a sense, innocent and guilty at the same time. If a situation gets out of hand and you have people throwing slurs at each other there is that famous expression: \"he crossed the line.\" Well even with critical hindsight, this \"line\" isn't always visible and when it is, it's faint.Spike Lee manages to show that very well and with a lot of diverse characters, hence the film being able to ring true with an equally diverse audience.The only problem is that in today's America the issue is more about class and not just race, though race and class are intertwined. \"Crash\" presented the issue of class and lifestyle a little bit more thoroughly, but in the end felt preachy and unrealistically sentimental. \"Do the Right Thing\" is much tighter and the film's climax and overall impact is more powerful. Also of the note is the terrific acting from the entire cast. --- 9/10Rated R for profanity and some violence",

    "review": "After moving house and witnessing his parents' marriage crumbling in front of him, Brian (Fred Savage) investigates his brothers claims that monsters keep coming from under his bed and scaring him at night. After swapping rooms, Brian is visited by a big blue monster, and the next night Brian manages to trap him in his room using his engineering skills. The monster turns out to be hyperactive troublemaker Maurice (Howie Mandel) who befriends Brian, and shows him the wonders of the monster world under his bed, where every night, the monsters reek havoc in the homes of young children. But the mysterious monster Boy (Frank Whaley) wants Brian for himself and keep him under the bed until the sun comes up, and thus turning him into a monster.Apart from the first four Rocky films, Little Monsters was hands down the main film I watched religiously as a child, my face no further than two feet from the TV screen. I remember finding it strangely eerie amongst all the fun, and being genuinely disturbed by some scenes. Boy's henchman Snik, a giant, hunchbacked monster with large bottom teeth, really frightened me, and the scene where he breaks one of Maurice's horns always shocked me. Re-visiting the film, roughly around fifteen years later, I can see that I was right to feel unnerved.Yes, the film is certainly childish and playful, but has a surprising line of darkness flowing through it from beginning to end. From early on, where Brian finds an overturned TV in the darkness of his closet that is showing the climax of The Fly, to the finale that sees Boy's face burned off to reveal a hideous face underneath, the film often steps out of the childhood safety area. It's certainly refreshing to see, and this sort of atmosphere can only be found in the Golden Age of kiddie flicks, the 80's, where films like The Dark Crystal and The Goonies showed creepy creatures and foul-mouthed kids that the target audience could really enjoy and relate to.Not to say that Little Monsters quite matches up to the two films just mentioned - it has some annoying child characters and Maurice does become slightly tiresome - but it is certainly an imaginative, funny and exciting little film. It's sad to see another of the key child stars of the era, Fred Savage, come out of the decade and dissolve into the woodwork, similar to the likes of Corey Feldman and Corey Haim. Although his maniacal behaviour does occasionally become exhausting, Howie Mandel's performance is certainly energetic, and you can't help but love him when he drinks a bully's apple juice, only to refill it with p**s. Hardly a classic, but certainly a film I will absolutely cherish from my youth, and will enjoy revisiting once every decade or so.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

    "review": "Mujrim is an unauthorised remake of Scarface, but as a film, it is really quite good. Actually it's much better than one would imagine. It's not a scene-by-scene copy but rather takes major plot elements, which is not that bad. The film tells the story of Shankar, who spent years in prison since childhood for having killed his uncle, who tried to sell Shankar's mother for alcohol. Once released, he attempts to get his life the right path, but never gets the right opportunity, and given his poverty and his mother's state, gives up and becomes the right hand of an underworld don.Mujrim is a mainstream Hindi film in many ways, but it is very well adapted into its Indian setting. The film explores issues of poverty, crime, religion and faith, and it does so rather effectively through the character of Shankar, his headstrong and devoted mother, and his transition from the slums to becoming the head of the organisation where he started merely as an assistant. Some of the scenes are quite tough viewing, and as the film proceeds, we see our hero trapped in his own web of crime and misdemeanors.The is stereotypical in many ways, but it also emphasises values of friendship, respect for elders, loyalty, provides commentary on social stigma and shows the destructive repercussions of the world of crime. Its romantic portions are quite good. The characters are quite well written, particularly that of Yashoda, who never wavers from her faith and the strength of her convictions. Anu Malik's music is very good. The title track is quite sad and very situationally relevant within the film as it comes after the film's most harrowing pictures of poverty. \"Naiyo Jeena Tere Bina\" is beautiful both melodically and visually.Mithun Chakraborty, one of India's most talented and prolific actors, does a fantastic job as Shankar. His performance is both moving and believable. Madhuri Dixit, as his young leading lady, is gorgeous and absolutely charming. Her transformation throughout the film is done really well. Shakti Kapoor gets a serious role for once and does it well, the same is true of Sharat Saxena who is excellent as Sonia's father and Shankar's kind boss. Amrish Puri is brilliant as the main villain. Pallavi Joshi as Shankar's sister is very good, and Suresh Oberoi is okay as the police officer.The most brilliant performance in the film is undoubtedly and unsurprisingly that of Nutan. As Yashoda, she is unaffected by the film's faults and comes across as a very real woman with her realistic acting and natural presence. Her character's perseverance and steadfast determination to keep her faith and never lose her moral integrity is never hard to believe. Due credit goes to her - Nutan shines in this film, creating the perfect epitome of Indian simplicity and honesty. Her expressions are as always highly impressive. This is one of the last performances of one of the greatest actresses to have graced the Indian screen.Mujrim is a good film, much better than expected, and great entertainment all in all. The ending is excellent, and it's quite sad that some good films never gained notice mainly because they were released at a time when most other products were not up to the mark. This one is worth a watch, not for everyone, but fans of Mithun Chakraborty and his many films during the time should definitely give it a try.",

    "review": "The film I will be reviewing is the documentary Thelonious Monk Straight No Chaser. This film is a documentary of the late Thelonious Monk born on October 10, 1917 in Rocky Mountain, North Carolina, who moved to Manhattan, New York, at the age of four. Thelonious was an American jazz pianist and composer, widely considered one of jazz's biggest figures and the founder of bebop. The interest in this move for me began the very first time I heard jazz. This was watching the movie Block Party with Dave Chappell. This movie shows a lot of black musicians and a little of what they do back stage. In some of the clips they show Dave Chappell playing with some of the musicians. In one clip in particular Dave is playing a piece from Thelonious Monk. Surprisingly it didn't occur to me that he was playing jazz from years ago because it went with contemporary music of the time. So I looked it up. What I found was a great heritage of music that is timeless which I would have never listened to, and that's what interested me in this documentaryStraight No Chaser starts with Monk's start as a musician and his hand in the start of bebop. This movie shows raw footage as Monk plays a popular song \"Rhythm-a-ning.\" The movie is especially interesting because it is in black and white and give's it that classic fill that monk gives off when he is playing. The movie explains how in the beginning not many knew Monk, even though he helped create the bebop style. They go through how he gained his popularity and showed great behind the scene pictures and clips of Monk. This movie is the perfect film for anyone interested in jazz or just the innovation of music. It is honest and holds nothing back from the life of this great musician. It glorifies his ups just as well as his downs. It also allows us to see in the life of a musician who was mostly private with his affairs and that makes it all the more interesting. The end of this movie is great for anyone who loves not only jazz but music in the creative sense. It shows how music affects the lives of people and how great and eclectic this musician really was.",

While Avatar has huge flaws in its story-telling including some scenes with very weak dialogue - it might have gotten away with it as the audience is perhaps distracted by the bombardment of impressive CGI effects!If you thought Avatar was good and haven't seen Dances with Wolves in a while - I highly recommend it.

It shows how wrapped up we can become when trying to achieve our goals through others and how it affects people around us.  I thought it was an interesting storyline and was a lot better than people give it credit for.",

    "plot": "After seeing Sharon Stone's performance as Lori in this movie, director Paul Verhoeven would cast her in the movie Basic Instinct - Iskallt beg\u00e4r (1992) due to her ability to play a character that could change from a timid charming sweetheart to a diabolical person and back again at a moment's notice. He also stated that this is the way Sharon Stone is in real life.",
    "review": "'Total Recall (1990)' is both an interesting, layered, concept-driven science-fiction film and a squishy, one-liner-filled, Arnold Schwarzenegger action romp, essentially, in equal measure. It's concerned just as much with its special effects and filled-to-the-brim squibs as it is with its twisty narrative and heady ideas. This contrast is, in practice, cohesion. It's what sets the piece apart from almost all others in its genre. It's enjoyable on all levels. It provides breathless, balls-to-the-wall action and an intriguing, ultimately fulfilling narrative filled with well-rounded characters and genuinely clever concepts. The world is incredibly creative and the tone is spot on, in typical Verhoeven fashion. The characters are also great, though, and the way they interact with the central conceit is brilliant. I won't spoil the main twist of the piece but it really is fantastic, something that you'll still be pondering - as a concept - long after the credits have rolled. On the whole, this is a really great film. It's tangible, exciting, inventive and, generally, just entertaining. 8/10",

    "plot": "Kevin Bacon originally resented being in Tremors, only agreeing to do it because he needed money for his new marriage and upcoming newborn child. When the film was not financially successful, Bacon feared his career was over, and in following years would refuse to acknowledge the film's existence and even called it the \"worst thing I ever did.\" However, Bacon would eventually come around to Tremors, calling the filming of Tremors to be \"the single most fun time I've ever had making a movie in my entire career\" in 2012, and later admitting in a 2020 interview \"When I was making Tremors, I was very depressed and at a low-point in my life, and I kinda blamed Tremors for all that. I was bitter against it, I thought it was a career-killer...I never watch my movies more than once, some of my movies I've never even seen before and have no desire to, but I've watched Tremors a dozen times. I love it so much, and I spent years trying to capture the same energy we had on the set of Tremors. It's one of my favorite films of all time.\"",
    "review": "Tremors was the kind of monster movie that seemed to find its way into my childhood video library - was it meant for kids, I have no idea (it's not not meant for them, if that makes sense) - and it was something that got repeat viewing. I think it was because the tone was sharp for this kind of material. The filmmakers had more of a budget than something like a Japanese Godzilla movie, and the actors, including people like Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward, are not taking a s*** so to speak, they're not there just to collect a paycheck (or if they are, they hide ir so well that you don't notice).The pacing is what keeps things tense and breakneck. The premise is simple: underground worms chase and hunt down townspeople in the tiny Perfection, Nevada. There's enough character in the set-ups with these people first though, with Bacon and Ward as laborers, and with the townspeople (Michael Gross and Victor Wong get some ample screen-time), and it helps that the filmmakers spend just enough time in the first ten-fifteen minutes so that we can care enough about them while also making them fairly comic characters.This is a fun movie. It doesn't have much pretension or things in the way to make it draw too much attention to it being \"art\". It's a killer-worms movie that gets some build-up early on for the what these worms are - first it's snakes and then it's the GIANT worm that's attached to everything and then when it gets going. And the special effects mostly hold up well with everything being practical effects. If you are inundated with CGI and don't remember a time when effects got to be MADE, not simply on a computer, with things moving quickly underground at people and shooting out of the ground with guns blazing at it and with gore flying everywhere. It's glorious work by talented craftsmen.So watch it knowing that it's funny, wild and made with energy and some clever characters (a couple being gun nuts, plus Reba McEntire!)",

    "review": "It's been 14 years since Tony Scott's The Last Boyscout was released and it was not a major hit at the box office.Too bad.Still, this guilty pleasure is one of funniest action movies ever made. The movie starts with the rocky (and cheesy) theme \"Friday Night is A Great Night For Football\" sung by Bill Medley. You can't top that way to begin a movie. But then Scott surprises us again. the opening sequence, where a football player is going to use any way possible to score a touchdown, is breath taking too. Enter Joe Hallenback (Willis) and Jimmy Dix (Wayans) two fallen heroes. One, a detective, the other an ex pro of the Stallion's league. The mob is there too, gamble, money, bets, a murdered young girl and big explosions. All of this wrapped up in a great story, which I won't spoil. This film is one of Tarantino's favorites. It's full of one liners and classic scenes. Violent and graphic. \"Touch me again and I kill you...\" says Willis' character to one of the gangsters. You should see the result. Written by Shane Black (Lethal Weapon) you've got a guarantee you're going to have a great time. Taylor Negron is great as Milo, the villain, a young and beautiful Halle Berry is Kory a girl that knows too much, the sexy Chelsea Field is Hallenback's wife and Danielle Harris is her daughter a great characters that nearly steals the show.This is not an \"art\" movie. It's pure entertainment, an excellent flick. Is anything better than that?",

I have to say that despite the fact that I wasn't blown away by the movie, it was a nice and honest film that you don't see in today's films, not to many are genuine like this.Vada is a little girl who basically surrounded by death in some aspects, her mother passed away and her father works in a funeral home.

But she has another love, an English teacher who's class she starts taking just to impress him, but another little boy, Tommy, has a little crush on Vada, but as soon as she realizes what she has lost, maybe she should take a closer look at things.My Girl is a sweet and charming film that could make anyone feel very good and just makes you want to hug someone afterwards, as cheesy as it may sound. Even though I didn't cry, it does have some sad little moments, Macaulay shined in this movie, you could just tell this kid was star bound, wish someone would give him a break, because he is slowly climbing to top again. But he and Jamie were the stars of the film and really made it worth a watch.6/10",

He was hired in advance by the owner of the Marsten Waters Ranch. When he arrives, things are definitely not what he expected due to the fawning treatment he receives from Marsten that comes with the request that he carry out a program of racial purity...Selleck's performance as Quigley is first rate. I easily believed that although Quigley had watched more than his share of Man's Inhumanity, yet he managed to hang onto his integrity. The character finds himself in a situation where his own actions can transform the circumstances for better. He did not go looking for a fight, but by God, he will finish this one.Even so, the character of Crazy Cora is my favorite. She is the victim of cruelty also but did not fare as well as Quigley. She is damaged goods, unable to take care of herself in any significant way when the story opens. In the course of the story, she is the one who recovers her Humanity. It is really her story as much as Quigley's.An excellent movie. Simon Sez check it out.",

    "plot": "No body doubles were used in any of the sex scenes.",
    "review": "Basic Instinct was an entry into the neo-noir genre of the 90's (The Last Seduction, Fatal Attraction etc ) that tried to update 40's/50's American film noir as well as bringing in elements of Hitchcock's Vertigo. On this level Basic Instinct is a brilliant conveyor of noir themes that portrays an unstable detective out of control in an intricate unfathomable plot with a femme fatale, Hollywood mansions, dark shadowy rooms, smart cynical dialogue and smoking. It is also flawed on this level with its unnatural characterisation. However, the artificiality of the plot, genre, characterisations and the look creates a distance between the viewer and the film. When you take this into account along with the constant references to watching in the film, outlined below, the film moves to a different level. It is no longer about whether Catherine Tramell is the killer but is more about the spectatorial process of watching a (Hollywood) film.For example, Catherine Tramell(Sharon Stone) is a writer whose murder plots exactly follow the murders that occur in the film. Her coolness and openness about these killings gives her a sense of being in control of Nick Curran's(Michael Douglas) destiny. In this way, she is like cinema itself spinning a predetermined plot line that the audience represented by Douglas just follows.Throughout the film, the detective seems resigned to his lack of control, totally in awe of Catherine Tramell ready to go along with her. This is similar to the way the audience submits itself inside the cinema to the control that the screen exerts. However just as we do, Curran attempts to predetermine the plot with his own expectations. He tells Tramell that he has his own idea how it will end - \"The cop survives\" - The final question of \"What do we do now, Nick?\" is met with \"F*** like minxes, raise rug rats, live happily ever after.\" another idealistic expectation of the cinema audience. However the ambiguous final shot reminds us that Douglas/the audience may not get the ending he wants - only cinema decides whether that ice pick under the bed will be used.Another parallel with the cinema experience is the way Nick Curran seems to identify with Tramell. At the start he is a recovered smoker and drinker and Tramell gets him to start again. Over the course of the film his attraction to Tramell's character makes him take on more and more of her traits - aggressive sexuality, risk taking, use of her dialogue and more and more leaps into fantasy. He is almost merging with her and this is reflected in his interrogation scene being shot identically to Tramell's earlier one. Again this development mirrors the way cinema audiences identify with the film narrative. The Hollywood ideal is that the viewer leaves his/her outside of the cinema in order to temporarily identify with the fantasy characters on screen.Another main aspect of the cinema experience touched on here is the voyeuristic process of watching itself. Curran is constantly in a spectatorial position. It is most obvious where he watches Tramell through a window that looks like a cinema screen itself. Another scene where he is trying to find out about Tramell on a computer sees him reprimanded by a colleague for \"jacking off to the screen\". This likens Douglas to an audience member watching the film in a similarly voyeuristic way. This is the reason why Hitchcock is such a strong influence on this film - these are classic Hitchcockian themes.My final comparison is the bi-directional aspect of cinema touched on in the film. The interrogation scene where Tramell manipulates the audience of detectives is the only time where Tramell has point of view, reminding us that cinema watches and manipulates us as well. Also the fact that throughout Tramell knows so much about Detective Curran's past is a similar device. Tramell uses what she knows about Curran to make her murder work, just as Hollywood exploits what it knows about our desires of movies in order to sell us their product. (And those desires may have been partly contrived by Hollywood).The female murderers (who look like old film stars) that Tramell hangs around with represent other archetypal Hollywood stories - maybe these could have been other films that Nick Curran watched before when he took up smoking before.Is it a coincidence that the words \"cinema theatre\" can be found in the name Catherine Tramell and the word \"audience\" can be found in \"Detective Nick Curran\" ? Probably.",

Hoping to find the place where the last Candyman killing took place, and to ask local residents what they might know. But they are asking too many questions, and this gets them some unwanted attention...leading to Helen (Virginia Madsen) getting beaten up.The guy who beat her up was pretending to be Candyman, in an attempt to intimidate people. Though, in reality, he is just the leader of one of the local gangs.So Helen becomes skeptical of Candyman's existence- thinking this is the source of the urban legend that the community holds onto so dearlyBut that was her greatest mistake...for now Candyman seeks vengeance...for f*cking with his legacy. He starts to take over Helen's mind- making her do things she would- she could- never fathom doing. And forces her into a position, where she must accept a deal with the devil...or, well, him...in order to save the life of an innocent baby who he has kidnapped.Now, she is wanted for murder, kidnapping, and animal cruelty...and finds herself institutionalized.Is Candyman really responsible for all these crimes...or is it all in her head? Nothing a quick summoning test won't clear up...This film is a pretty cool combination of slasher and psychological thriller, with some decent gore and awesome death scenes. Honestly, I'm really surprised I've never watched it until now. It sets you up for the gore with some cheap scares. But that final scene where Candyman is about to kill Helen is wicked. And the final twist at the end was a welcome surprise.Looking forward to the rest of the trilogy.6.5 out of 10.",

    "review": "Like Water for Chocolate is a masterpiece in that it conveys the essence of our ancestors' knowledge forgotten in the fast pace of modern living.It centers around the wonder of cooking: a sacred ritual, not a boring chore; and when done right, with love, it creates magic.  Raised and taught to cook by her old Mayan nanny, Tita (exquisitely performed by Lumi Cavazos) masters the near-magical ability of transferring her love and other feelings into her creations passed into one who eats them.The characters\u0091 senses are so refined, they enable everyone involved in this family drama to be tuned to the finest nuances of their world, opening the door to non-material pleasures.  Rich with metaphors, their language reflects the skills of keen and sometimes humorous observation.  The story brings our perception to a different level - as its characters' empathy borders on miracles and magic, and things we only sense and feel become real.  Tita's virgin breasts, feeling `like dough kneaded' by strong hands, turn into mature breasts under Pedro's burning eyes (to later start lactating) - their glances, just like her food, becoming the means of communicating their forbidden love.Yet all magic becomes wasted in the face of a man's choice.  The Universe may scream into Pedro's ears about the path he is to take, but if he doesn't follow it, no magic can save him. We witness the story of a fatal attraction between two soulmates, whose passion, confined by an enslaving family tradition, lights up everyone around them... But for themselves, it's so intense, it literally engulfs the lovers in flames.  Did they have an alternative?  It is for the viewer to figure out.You may ponder, however, over the young doctor's Indian grandmother saying that `each  of us is born with a box of matches inside but we can't strike them all by ourselves; we need oxygen and a candle to help.  The oxygen would come from a lover's breath; the candle could be a food, a melody, a word, a caress, or a sound...' He remembers her warning, though, that `it  is important to light the matches one at a time' because otherwise the heat generated  would produce too dazzling a brilliance.Thus the wisdom of the ages, just like the power, is passed here through women and the men who are in tune with them.  And the intense interactions between the colorful characters of five generations extend to dead family members who continue to counsel or despise the living.When coming into her room with Pedro after 22 years of their waiting for each other, Tita is greeted by her long deceased nanny lighting her bed and the room with multiple candles.  And the consequences of one's actions carries on beyond time - as each person continues her path notwithstanding death.Hot yellow-red colors intermixed with dense lighting rekindle one's passion for living and appreciation for the gifts and mysteries of the Mexican land.

    "review": "This wonderful movie is even better on the repeat viewing after the secret was out because you'd pay more attention to the smallest details and enjoy the brilliant storytelling and acting by everyone. Besides Rea, Whitaker, and Miranda Richardson, I'd like to mention Jim Broadbent as a sympathetic bartender Col. For me, though, the absolutely stunning, one of the very best debuts in the movie history was Jaye Davidson who had no movie experience. You know, there are not many characters that I keep thinking about after the movie is over - where did they come from, how their life would turn after the final credits, how would this cruel world treat them, would they be happy? And I want them to be happy. Dil (Davidson) is one of them - what a marvelous creature, how vulnerable yet dignified she is, what a combination of dry remote coolness and quiet tenderness. No wonder, Fergus (Rea) (as Whitaker's Jody before him) fell under her spell even after he found out that nothing is what it seems. Great movie - makes you think, makes you feel, makes you talk about it, makes you want to see it again.9.5/10",

The film is built around a compelling and often forgotten segment of black history that maintains social resonance beyond its time and place; director Julie Dash deserves credit for capturing the emotion and pain of cultural transformation, and there are lovely images throughout. But Daughters of the Dust makes very little effort to engage the audience: it's difficult to maintain a sense of each character's individual goals, and the film often sacrifices narrative momentum for visual poetry. Unfortunately, I'm left with a film that interests me more in theory than in practice. -TK 9/30/10",

    "review": "The literary period piece is a difficult genre to master, requiring a difficult balancing between restraint and flowing emotion.  Few films effectively achieve this as beautifully as  Merchant-Ivory's astounding HOWARDS END, making it probably the best period film of the 1990's.  The film juxtapositions the intellectual, emotionally unhindered Schlegel sisters against the restrained, imperious Wilcox family, and, for good measure, mixes in the differing attitudes toward class emerging early in the century.  What could quite easily have been a dry study in the cultural dynamics of pre-WWI England becomes an enveloping tale, thanks in no small part to the performances by Hopkins, Emma Thompson, and Vanessa Redgrave, whose Ruth Wilcox remains enigmatic after every viewing.  The emotions ringing through by film's end - not to mention its astoundingly pointed social criticism - give the film its power, a power missing even from Forster's rambling, distant novel.  And this story is nestled amongst some of the most beautiful art direction, music, and cinematography to ever grace the screen.  The haunting journey to HOWARDS END is one few other recent films can rival.",

Unfortunately, a novel adapted to a film will almost never be as good as the book because there just isn't enough time or money to include everything and make everything look as good as it reads. This is evident here. Having said that they certainly didn't leave it to the story to support itself. Impressive heroics from Ford and a superb bad guy performance from Sean Bean (strikingly similar to his performance in the James Bond film Golden Eye) turned Clancy's classy classic book into a classy film. I was also impressed to discover that the director was none other than Australia's Phillip Noyce. As is also sadly common among films made from books, the plot was a little hard to follow due to the audience having to fill in the gaps that were left by the film makers not having time or money to include it all.",

That's Baz Luhrmann, who is an expert at swinging a visual feast; and Strictly Ballroom is his red curtain trio opening(together with Romeo+Juliet and Moulin Rouge!). With his own style of cinematography and overdrive speed of camera work, it's impossible to watch a 94 minutes film in exact 94 minutes. Otherwise you'd be falling into anxiety saying to yourself: \"Ooops! Did i just miss a scene?\" I still rewind on many scenes each time I watch Strictly Ballroom and Moulin Rouge! Here are some unforgettable and timelessly cult scenes and moments I most like: 1- Scott&Francesca dancing in front of the Coca Cola broad sheet at the roof 2- Scott&Francesca dancing with Doris Day's \"Perhaps,Perhaps, Perhaps(1954 version)\" behind the red curtain 3- Francesca and Scott's meeting scene and the way she introducing herself to Scott 4- Scott practicing his style of dance and watching himself by the mirror 5- Scott's father starting clapping in unison when Scott&Francesca turned back to the stage where they are banned 6- Francesca persuading Scott upon the choices they look forward to make beside the wire fences they walk through in the nightStrictly Ballroom is one of the best choices to watch and enjoy it with your beloved. It will keep you locked in a close embrace. It is also the best choice to start learning couples' dancing. But, if you're looking for some silver screen accomplishment, which I mostly do for every movie I watched, there is only the noteworthy achievement of costume design. Directing-editing-screenplay are collaboratively proper since it is Baz Luhrmann's own project. I only disliked the sound editing.",

    "review": "First of all, I want to say some of my thoughts about IMDb ratings. If you look at IMDb top 250 you can hardly find any family movie . In fact, there are only three family movie (I mean live action movies not animated flicks) in this chart. They are Princess Bride on the 99 position (haven't seen yet), A Christmas Story on 142 (a movie nobody heard of besides English speaking countries) and the E.T. on the 244 (forever classic - no point denying that). And I bet you would be unable to find another one even in top 500. On the other hand you can find in this list, for example, more than eighty thrillers or more than thirty 30 war movies. Does that result means that family movies can't be good. Obviously it is not. For me the point is that many of people as well as lots of critics don't appreciate movies sweet movies without profanity, drugs, sex and violence. Cheesy movie for kids only that's not a fair grade. Well it's only my opinion but for me it's very sad when such a beautiful movie become so undeservedly underrated. Now, more directly to our movie. I watched Free Willy no less than four or five times and found it one of the best family and animal movie ever made. The bonds of friendship between man and animal are shown incredibility well here. From this point Free Willy remembered me another beautiful animal movie The Black Stallion. The unlikely friendship between twelve years old Jesse and giant whale as the main element of the story is very sweet and touching. Overall plot is well constructed (and there's no point to complain its unreality) with decent development of the main characters. Young and definitely talented Jason Jammes Richter created terrific performance of a young lonely problem boy Jesse. Also very good in the movie were August Schellenberg (as Randolph) and Michael Madsen (as Glen). As I always mentioned cinematography is pretty good, including first-rate animal action (Keiko is so cute there). The beautiful movie soundtrack written by Basil Poleuydouris a bit resembled for me terrific Carmine Coppola's score for The Black Stallion. And finally, that's maybe the most important Free Willy is a very humanistic movie, a movie that what was made with love and care about nature. Thanks to Simon Wincer for this great masterpiece. We need more movies like this, not a laughable rubbish that Hollywood studios now provide for family entertainment. I rated Free Willy 10 out of 10 as an excellent and beautiful family friendly movie. Check out also its two sequels. They are also pretty good.Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English.",

Colorful and appropriate cinematography by John Bailey . The motion picture waas well directed by Wolfgang Petersen, from casting to scripting the movie was notable and our director made a good job . Wolfgang first big hit was \u00a8Das Boot\u00a8 , following \u00a8The NeverEnding Story\u00a8, and going on Hollywood productions as \u00a8Shattered\u00a8 , \u00a8Enemy mine\u00a8 . And a series of disaster genre movies as \u00a8Outbreak\u00a8(1995) about the outbreak of a killer virus. This film had shades of an Irwin Allen disaster movie, The Swarm (1978), about the outbreak of killer bees. Both films had the military and scientists clash, also both had choppers all over the place. Then came \u00a8Air Force One\u00a8 (1997), about terrorists taking over the presidents plane. This film had shades of a 1970s Airport disaster film . \u00a8The Perfect Storm\u00a8 (2000) came next, and while the script about a boat at sea in a storm was okay, the constant fake looking computer generated sea water damaged the film. And then came \u00a8Poseidon\u00a8 (2006) that was Petersen's worst action/disaster movie by a long way, dealing with a passenger ship turning over at sea. Outbreak just hinted at being an Irwin Allen remake , but with Poseidon Petersen failed at boxoffice , it was now official this was a remake of Allen's The Poseidon Adventure . Rating : 7/10 . Better than average . Well worth watching . The flick will appeal to Clint Eastwood fans .",

    "review": "Like many of Bollywood movies from the pre-millienia era, themes of cause and effect are heavy factors in the reality of life in crime driven cities in the world. In this case the anti- hero (Ballu) played by Sanjay Dutt, intensely well. Many scenes seems to parable the realities of his life at that current time and perhaps the inner demons he faced.In the world of crime, there are puppets and then there are puppeteers, poverty and \"purposeful terrorism\" in the name of business. Madurai Dixit plays her beautiful self, graceful and fiesty as always. Watch it to understand the cause and effect of crime in poverty driven societies and how we create the villains for our heroes. Perhaps it is the simplest definition of human archetype; conflict.",

Denzel Washington, in his portrayal of Joe Miller, the ex-homophobic who decides to help Andrew win his case, is excellent, deserving of a Best Supporting Actor award.

    "review": "\"The Piano\", directed by Jane Campion, is a haunting film about love, passion, betrayal and refusal set in the 19th century. Ada (Holly Hunter), sent to New Zealand on an arranged marriage, arrives with her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) and her precious piano on a stormy gray beach. Her husband Stewart (Sam Neill) leaves her beloved piano on the beach after having decided that it is too heavy to transport it inland. He does not recognize what this means to the mute Ada, who expresses her emotions with the \"voice\" of her piano. Baines (Harvey Keitel), who has taken on Maori ways, is deeply moved by Ada and her \"voice\". He gives Stewart a piece of land in exchange for the piano and offers Ada a deal to earn it back.Repulsed by Baines' crude appearance, Ada reluctantly accepts the deal to play the piano in his hut while he does \"things\". Submerged erotic desires and passion slowly set free between the unlikely pair during the piano sessions. Both Baines and Stewart become obsessed by Ada's powerful, intensely suggestive form of unuttered communication. Completely bewildered, Stewart asks Baines if had ever heard Ada speak a single word to him, claiming that he could hear her voice in his mind.The breathtaking, beautiful imagery as well as its stirring music (Michael Nyman) contribute to the romantic, mystifying atmosphere of the film. \"The Piano\" won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and Oscars for Best Actress (Holly Hunt), Best Supporting Actress (Anna Paquin), and Campion's screenplay. Holly Hunter's outstanding performance conveys impressively a woman's ability to express herself without words. \"The Piano\" is one of the best films I have seen so far.",

    "review": "'Sliver' takes a mish-mash of different ingredients and combines them in pursuit of being a highly charged piece of entertainment from the Hollywood movie making machine. One part romance. Two parts torrid sexuality. One part murder mystery whodunit. One part soapbox commentary on surveillance & technology. It shouldn't work. It should collapse under all it's weight, but it doesn't. It's a fun trip.Carly Norris (Sharon Stone) a newly divorced book editor lands an upscale apartment in a trendy building in NYC after it's previous female tenant is murdered. She may not being looking for another relationship so soon, but certainly misses physical intimacy. She doesn't have to look any further than eager building residents Jack Landsford (Tom Berenger) an accomplished published writer and the mysterious Zeke Hawkins (William Baldwin) to accomplish that. Of course tenants are dropping like flies in this building and if she wants to stay alive, she better get to the bottom of things and pick the right guy, eh.Written by Joe Eszterhas (Jagged Edge, Basic Instinct) and directed by Phillip Noyce (Clear and Present Danger), I had a pretty fun time watching 'Sliver' in spite of myself and the material on hand. Stone can do this role in her sleep. Smart, disarming sexuality. Baldwin is weirdly charming while Tom Berenger is always a treat to watch unravel. You can also catch Martin Landau as Stone's boss and CCH Pounder as a police detective.'Sliver' features laughs (intentional or not), sex acts and an abrupt ending that doesn't leave any ambiguity. Spelling everything out for you in a satisfying manner leaving it being an effective one time watch. There isn't much of depth to really take away - other than most of the characters featured are damaged - but I had a good voyeuristic time watching the sometimes smart, sometimes trashy material play itself out.",

    "review": "Small American towns nurture kindness and big hearts, as personified by Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp), a twenty year old guy who heads a loving but difficult family of two younger sisters, a mentally retarded younger brother named Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), and their obese momma (Darlene Cates). These are humble, unpretentious common folks who do the best they can. But life in a small town in Iowa is hard, and it can be frustrating and confining. At times, you can feel ... trapped.The film's theme is explicit. Gilbert is trapped in a vexing family. Arnie is trapped in a body with a flawed brain. Momma is trapped in an obese body. A local woman named Betty (Mary Steenburgen) is trapped in an unsatisfying marriage. A young woman named Becky (Juliette Lewis) is trapped with her grandmother in the town by an RV that has broken down while passing through. Even a grasshopper gets trapped in Arnie's mischievous hands.Seeing good people trapped in difficult situations is poignant. The film really tugs at your heartstrings. In one sequence, momma must face gawkers as she leaves the courthouse. Her response is inspiring and majestic. Darlene Cates does a wonderful job in this role.Gilbert and his family live in a modest house. Its interior reminds me of the grim, depressing house in the movie \"Silkwood\" (1983). The dinner table must be moved each meal to wherever momma is sitting. And typical family conversation centers on preparation for Arnie's birthday party, and debate over ways to cook bacon.A friend helps Gilbert reinforce the wood floor under Gilbert's house, so that the floor won't collapse under the weight of momma. Gilbert is kind, and has a big heart. And he is very protective of Arnie who has a habit of climbing up the town's water tower.The townsfolk are satisfied with fulfilling small dreams, like getting a job at the new burger barn, or getting an ice cream snack at the local \"Dairy Dreme\". Small American towns ... life is familial and loving, but it can also be confining. And this film reminds me a lot of \"The Last Picture Show\" (1971).The acting in \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\" is very good, as is the color cinematography, and production design. I did find the Arnie character to be a bit grating at times. The film's plot is slightly repetitive. And I don't care for the film's title. But these are minor issues.\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\" is a heartfelt story about life in a small American town, with all its kindness, big hearts, and familial love, despite the hardships. The film is worth a serious look, for its thematic depth, for its acting, and for its attention to detail in sets and production design.",

So the plot may be a little far stretched and the sub plots may be a little distracting (referring to the transvestites) but all in all what a powerful film! \"Bollywood\" is accustomed to certain codes and conventions so lets not forget we are watching a film from a completely different arena (compared to Hollywood).Now to the songs (a key feature of any \"Bollywood\" film)... Badi Mushkil Hai, Channe Ke Khet mein, Tu samne jab aata hai and Barson ki baad - all top notch! Maybe its become common knowledge now but Barson ki baad was taken in one single shot! That doesn't happen often now does it?! Madhuri is sensuous, alluring and enchanting in her seduction...nothing is vulgar about this - can't say that about the heroines of today! I don't think you have to be a fan of either Shah Rukh or Madhuri to appreciate this unique film... However, one does ponder if their performances were the real pull for this film - I can't imagine anyone else in their place! Final thought: if you are sick of the stuff \"Bollywood\" is churning out these days - go back to the 90's and make sure you pay Anjaam a visit!",

This film is entertaining from start to finish with a surprisingly clever plot considering the genre and credit must go to Ford for starring and excelling in yet another blockbuster. People may say he's not the most versatile actor in the world and I'm not going to disagree, but he does what he does brilliantly and those who don't enjoy this movie really do need a good talking to.

Sunil, realizing the budding relationship between Anna and Chris decides to take things into his own hands by trying to create rifts between the two and taking advantage of the situations to woo Anna himself. Supporting these three are Sunil's family, his musical friends (look a little closer and you'll see Ashutosh Gowarikar among them) and also the local Father (Naseeruddin Shah) who acts as Sunil's mentor.This may sound like a very simple and typical love triangle, which it is. What makes it different is Sunil. His character is one that is rarely seen in Indian cinema, yet not unfamiliar to us because we've met hundreds of Sunils in our lifetime. We ourselves might be a Sunil. He is that real. He has no great physical strength (Shahrukh in 93? puny!), or great intelligence (he failed the same class several times)or great wealth (his father is a mechanic). He is a regular Joe trying to get the girl he loves.Sunil happens to be Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa's greatest asset. We see everything and everyone through his eyes which makes his world real to us. The things he does are things we might do when in love. What he ultimately does in the end might reflect on who many of us really are on the inside: simple people who love their family and friends.A lot of people believe Shahrukh Khan became an actor with Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge in '95. The truth is that he was well on his way to becoming a legend in Indian cinema with this movie. He IS Sunil. He breathes life into the role making it much more than just a character in a story, he brings Sunil to life, he brings Sunil to us. He is brilliant. Just watch the film.",

I saw Major Payne again a couple of weeks ago, and I'll tell you what, there is a lot of stuff that is much, much, funnier after having a drill instructor do the same to you.  If you are one of the few and the proud, I'd highly recommend this movie.  Trust me, you'll be able to relate.",

Maybe one ought to come from an Arabic background and culture to truly appreciate the avant-gardism but it is still a good movie on several levels: The scenery is amazing. The acting is great. For example, Khaled El Nabaoui was a new actor back then and he truly proved himself through this movie. Yusra as usual is a great actor. Ahmad Bedir who seems to be one of Chahine's most preferred actors (he appeared in several of his movie) was astonishing.

Shaolin Soccer was a real revelation but it could have been a unique instance. Kung Fu Hustle showed me that he was an accomplished comedic talent. I have been trying to find his earlier films and am finally succeeding. I encourage you to do the same.There's a lot to compare Chow with the classic comedians of the US film industry. Unlike Jacky Chan who has publicly stated his fondness for Buster Keaton, Chow seems to be more related to Harold Lloyd style. A low key personality in crazy situations. Unlike Chan and many other HK performers, Chow never forces his personality over the top. He surrounds himself with inventive situations and great supporting characters. The one unique aspect about Chow is the philosophic nature of many of the characters he plays. This film is a good example. Lots of very good comic situations and a great climax. The main drawback is the overused wide-angle cinematography which make the film look cheaper then it should. This film has a lot in common with his more famous films so it should be enjoyable.Good time.",

    "review": "One of the early scenes in \"Pulp Fiction\" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, \"Pulp Fiction\" wouldn't be \"Pulp Fiction.\" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. \"Pulp Fiction,\" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or \"art about art.\" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, \"Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,\" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, \"That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.\"What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really \"about\" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.",

    "review": "WYATT EARP, the second of the epic films about the legendary lawman released between 1993-94, lacked the commercial values that made TOMBSTONE successful, but was a far riskier film, with higher aspirations. Writer/Director Lawrence Kasdan, whose previous Western, SILVERADO (1985), had paid homage to Hollywood's Western clich\u00e9s, wanted, with WYATT EARP, to cut through the myths, and create a film that would honestly examine an all-too-human Earp's life in the 'real' West, set against vistas of that were nearly overpowering in their immense size and beauty. Unfortunately, the result was a mixed bag; while the film is beautiful to look at (with one of the most majestic film scores of recent years, composed by James Newton Howard), the characters (with the exception of Dennis Quaid's 'Doc Holiday') lack charisma, with Kevin Costner's portrayal of Earp so flat that it is difficult to arouse much interest in him (it would be nearly ten years before he finally 'got it right', in OPEN RANGE). The film ultimately comes across as overblown and overlong, with it's memorable moments nearly lost amid panoramic views of the West.I still think, however, that WYATT EARP has a few redeeming qualities which make it worth viewing. Foremost is Dennis Quaid, giving the performance of a lifetime as the dying Doc Holiday. The actor lost over forty pounds to play the role, and is physically the closest in appearance to the dentist-turned-gambler/gunfighter of all the actors who have ever portrayed him. Gaunt, dripping sarcasm with a Southern accent between hacking tubercular coughs, Quaid seizes each scene he's in, and certainly deserved Oscar consideration. It is ironic that his performance had to follow TOMBSTONE's flamboyant 'Doc', Val Kilmer, who created such an over-the-top, audience-friendly character, that Quaid's more realistic portrayal would be forgotten.Another reason to watch WYATT EARP is it's presentation of the infamous Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and it's aftermath. With the exception of John Sturges' HOUR OF THE GUN, no Westerns before TOMBSTONE and WYATT EARP had told the full story of the events, from the brief but deadly shootout, through the subsequent murder trial against the Earps, and Ike Clanton's vengeance, afterwards, resulting in Morgan Earp's murder, and Virgil Earp being crippled for life. Wyatt's bloody vendetta against Clanton and his allies was a grim reminder of 'frontier justice' and his ruthlessness even appalled Doc Holliday. The film doesn't attempt to gloss over or glorify Earp's actions, but does try to explain it, as an obligation to his family, who were the cornerstone of his life. Unfortunately, it took WYATT EARP nearly two hours to finally reach Tombstone, by which time audiences were fidgeting in their seats!Uneven, but at times powerful, WYATT EARP was a major box office failure when released, and it never achieved the 'Classic' stature TOMBSTONE has, over the years. But it isn't a bad film, and Kasdan should be credited for his willingness to take an original look at a Western legend. It will be interesting to hear his comments, if a 'Director's Cut' DVD is ever released!",

    "review": "The 'buddy comedy' genre is fairly well-known, there have been plenty of them, all of them primarily based on the basic idea of having two main characters who are, well, buddies; they act like friends to each other, they get in fights, they help each other out, they compliment each other. It's a fairly easy genre to master, and an easy way to make a good movie. This is one of the best examples, since Smith and Lawrence really do compliment each other so well; Smith's the sleek, cool one who is popular with the ladies, while Lawrence is often nervous, and pretty much a direct opposite of Smith. They have pretty good on-screen chemistry, too; you believe that these are good friends and partners. My only real problem with the film is the way the comedy almost all is generated by stereotypes, and, worse, the age-old complications that arise from certain situations. I think that's a little unoriginal, but, hey, that's the only complaint about it, and the film does have some very entertaining comedy parts. The plot is pretty good, it keeps the film going and supplies every single scene with comedy, action, or both. It takes off immediately, and keeps a good pace throughout the 2 hour duration. The acting is all pretty good. The characters are well-written, well, for stereotypes at least(because, lets face it; they are). The comedy is well-done and often made me laugh out loud, and, believe me, I am not, in any way, shape or form, a Will Smith fan. The action was well-done too, intense and exciting. The film, all in all, was pretty good, very entertaining. For a buddy comedy, it's good. For an action comedy, it's good too. I recommend it to all fans of action comedies, and buddy comedies. 7/10",

Mainly we were laughing at the over-the-top Scottish accent of Fraser and Malky's bungling sidekicks. The theme tune was a cheap as it could have been and the only reason we watched it was because we were about thirteen and 10 and they repeated the advert so many times we felt compelled to do so. But the story lines were so off the wall that you couldn't help but fall for its charms. My favourite episode was the one where Fraser faked his own death (for the insurance pay out, I think) and then rose up from the coffin singing \"My Way\" at his funeral. Genius!It's actually one of my biggest regrets that I never saw the series finale to this show: the ratings were obviously awful because it lost its normal slot after three or four shows and kept getting moved around. I'll never be able to forget \"Bad Boys\" for this reason, since I suddenly saw that the final episode was on and tried to record it because my Mum was watching something else (probably the news or something else pointless like that). No doubt influenced by the slapstick violence of the programme, I reacted badly when my Mum stopped the video (since I was \"disturbing\" the news).

Twinkle Khanna, the actress did a really great act in the film Barsaat. Although still new, he showed the audience that he was very great. As a connoisseur of films, of course I do not agree if Twinkle is famous because his father and mother were famous actors in the past. Twinkle has acting talent that was inherited by his parents! Likewise with Bobby, he did very, very great acting. Nadeem Shravan has created music that is pleasant to hear. Alka Yagnik has filled the Twinkle vocals very well. I love her sound. My judgment is 8/10",

    "review": "After a 6 year hiatus due to protracted legal wranglings as to WHO owned the BOND film rights, GOLDENEYE was finally made! It was worth the wait! With the almost impossible assignment of both retaining the quintessential METHOD of the Connery period and the need to drag Bond screaming into the new millennium and its new technology, Martin Campbell actually pulled it off.Brosnan, though not my personal favorite I have to say, did a damn near remarkable job, by not only bringing elements of Connery, Dalton and Moore to the role, but by stamping it with his own identity (he WAS actually first choice ahead of Dalton but was contractually tied to REMINGTON STEELE and could not gain a release!)Wishing to link back with the earlier mega successful Bonds, the very title of GOLDENEYE was inspirational, immediately bringing to mind the latent image of GOLDFINGER. Not one half bad title song either compared to some recent efforts.With Bernard Lee's sad demise, Judy Dench made a brilliant replacement as M, all balls and bravado. Similarly, Moneypenny is now a strictly new-age secretary admonishing 007 for his sexual harassment of her good self! Dearest of all, Desmond Llewelyn still shines as \"Q\" berating 007 for his behaviour and telling him to \"grow up.\"Famke Janssen is a throw-back to the good old days of Bond badgirls as the aptly named Xenia Onatopp. Izabella Scorupco however must be the most beautiful of all the \"good\" Bond girls. Feminine to the core and everything the average man would want to love and protect she is is simply yummy.....no more so than when she chides 007's cold-war repartee with his Russian counterpart as \"Boys with Toys\"  Soo cute!Action was at a premium from the rip-snorting bungee-jump (pre-credits) to the climactic battle atop the communications tower. Everything gelled in this movie to elevate it to amongst the top 5 Bond films...no question! Top dialog, state of the art fx, innuendos on tap and a really first rate villain. Shame none of the later Brosnan outings have come close to this one!8.8 out of 10!",

With tensions running high, Mangold went to Winters and told her that she had to make things right with him. Winters begrudgingly agreed and on the next day when they were preparing to shoot, Winters had Vince meet her on set in front of the cast and crew. Winters told Vince of all the famous people she's worked with, including Gene Hackman and Stanley Kubrick and the insults she called them, telling Vince that he now joined a long list of respected Hollywood people that she had insulted. Mangold said the tensions had gone away after that and they worked together well.",
    "review": "Strong performances and great restraint make Heavy a deftly handled, beautiful and subtly moving piece. Despite the apparent futility of Victor's interest in Callie, they're both changed in ways which are worth seeing. Aside from Evan Dando's slight awkwardness, the acting in this film is understated and very believable - Shelley Winters is warm and careworn, even Debbie Harry manages to blend in to the low-key scenery. Beautifully shot and directed, with a superb score from Thurston Moore, \"Heavy\" is a piece of cinema rather than a story shoe-horned into a screenplay. This won't satisfy anyone looking for simple plot and resolution, but for the rest of us there's a lot to admire.",

    "review": "I might be coming from a bit of a biased angle here but I remember seeing this film countless times growing up. It was recorded from TV on a blank VHS tape by my grandmother and I will never forget those days watching it over at her house. The point is, if I seem a bit too positive about this film, it's because I will always associate it with those childhood memories.With that said, The Indian in the Cupboard is a perfectly fine film. As someone who likes films that are on a smaller scale, I do enjoy this, more or less, slice-of-life style and it is actually quite refreshing with its slower pace and more relaxed cinematography when compared to many of the big blockbuster films that come out today.One thing I really have to commend this film for are its visual effects. Bringing to life the idea of tiny people and big people interacting and existing in the same frame, as well as the environments the little people are in have aged surprisingly well. I will admit, when revisiting this film, I was a little apprehensive about whether or not the special effects would hold up, as even some of the big blockbusters from years later that rely heavily on special effects don't hold up over time. 25 years later, however, this film still looks as good as it did to me back when I was a kid. I was pleasantly surprised as, by no means did I ever think that anything in this film looked too artificial or bad in any way.The soundtrack, I remember, was one of my favorite aspects of this film back when I was a kid, and it too, stands the test of time. Not only does it help sell the sentimental direction of the film, but it also helps to serve as something of a time capsule of what the 90s were kind of like.I can't help but feel like this film is a genuine product of the 1990s, but not the obnoxious side of it that is constantly celebrated across the internet. I think it captures the 90s in more of a down-to-earth sense. It's difficult to explain but the side of the 90s it captures is that good-feeling and a sense of innocence that I believe many people are nostalgic for. For me personally, while watching this it seemed only natural that after it was over, I would go and play a Super Nintendo game or something. This film really does a good job at taking one back to the simpler times, I think.For the most part, the acting in this film is fine. The only real note about it I have is that sometimes Omri's reaction shots look less like reactions and more like blank stares, and since they hold those particular shots for long periods of time, they kind of alternate between funny and unsettling. But it isn't fair to criticize child actors too much, and other than that, the kids in this film do an excellent job at portraying kids. Sometimes films that use child actors have the tendency to have child actors act like the adult director's approximation of how a kid would act and as a result, it comes off as very silly- this film does not have that problem and I'm happy that that's the case.I think the thing that keeps this film from crossing into a higher score, for me, is that, while I greatly enjoyed it, I'm not sure if it would be considered something necessarily special by someone who does not have a history with it like I do. With that said, I do highly recommend it as I think it is a film worth seeing for a number of reasons. I was sure this was more of a Hallmark-type of film, but it got a theatrical release and, perhaps, it's of higher quality as a result? I highly recommend it and I can't do so enough.",

When the two girls meet unexpectidly they decide to switch places so tough girl Amanda can get rid of Clarise, and smart and witty Alyssa can get rid of the ButtKisses, the odd family who wants to adopt Amanda. The girls try to succeed in getting Diane and Roger together before his marraige to Clarise, and get Diane and Roger to adopt Amanda before the ButtKisses can. Philip Bosco also stars as Vincenzo, the loveable sweet butler of the Calaway's who always gives Alyssa a lot of slack and benifit of the doubt when it comes to her little silly escapades. All and all this is a great movie for everyone to enjoy. Great Cast, Great Movie, and the Olsen Twins at their best. 9-10/10!",

We might identify with Max who blatantly doesn't know what to do now. Max's only hellbent on not looking back on his college years, \"I'm nostalgic for conversations I had yesterday. I've begun reminiscing events before they even occur. I'm reminiscing this right now. I can't go to the bar because I've already looked back on it in my memory... and I didn't have a good time.\" Kicking and Screaming is a film deserving to be recognize as a journey through the minds of graduates and self-discovery of oneself.",

This list includes such well-known films as \"A Hero Never Dies,\" \"Lifeline,\" and \"Running out of Time.\"  \"Loving You\" was made in 1995, prior to the emergence of both artists as icons of the Hong Kong crime dramas of the late 1990's.  I was very interested in watching this early collaboration, in hopes of seeing glimpses of the greatness that was to come.  I am glad to report that the film did not disappoint me. Lau stars as a cop who is dedicated to his job, but is a pretty rotten human being.  He cheats on his wife, and doesn't show any sympathy or kindness to those around him.  This all changes when he is shot in the head by a rather vicious drug-dealer.  I guess a near-death experience had quite an effect on him, and he spends the rest of the film trying to make up for past wrongs. Much of my enjoyment of the film comes from Lau's excellent performance. The film's direction does not show a lot of the style that would bring Johnny To to the forefront of the Hong Kong action genre, but the action scenes are done well.  With actors like Lau and the beautiful Carman Lee (from \"Lifeline\"), the dramatic scenes are also quite touching.  The only thing that I did not really like were the sappy love songs that were in the film.  I can usually handle one sappy love song, but this film had three. Aside from that minor complaint, I thoroughly enjoyed the film.",

    "review": "Despite the movie being as mid-90s as it is, the craft still surprisingly holds up really well today. Of course the main reason being just how well written and relatable our 4 lead characters are. They all come from backgrounds and struggles we all can relate to one way or another. Rather it being broken families, body self-consciousness, or even being bullied for racism. They have incredible chemistry together & can't deny you want to be part of this group. The Witchcraft element is played out very believable & we cheer to see our leads get their happiness. But as we all know sometimes great power can fall in the wrong hands. Cannot think of a better cast from that time period to play these roles. Robin Tunney, a pre-scream Neve Campbell, Rachel True, and of course Fairuza Balk's now iconic performance as the raunchy, sinister, & gorgeous Nancy Downs.My only issue with the film is a couple of weak moments with character choices. First is the whole love spell storyline with Sarah and this bully named Chris. It doesn't seem clear if she actually really liked him or just wanted to play him for what he did. Also later in the film it doesn't make sense why two of the girls side with Nancy to attack Sarah. They even try to apologize at the end like nearly killing her was just a joke or something.Despite those flaws the craft is an excellent time. Give it a watch and join the cult weirdo.",

Still the movie can't get more than 7 out of 10, being so cliche-heavy and not-so-thrilling when it comes to the human characters (though I have to agree with some of the other reviewers, that this movie is decent in the way it avoids splatter-effects and is remarkably un-blood-thirsty).",

    "review": "I saw this in 1996 and thought it was extremely entertaining--an action movie with emphasis on suspense over shoot-em-up thrillers and explosions. Seeing it again, after the events in the past 4 years, is a different experience. Some of the fictional dialog has actually been quoted by fanatics in the news. I had the same reaction with Black Sunday with Robert Shaw. A movie meant as pure escapism is now more like \"what if.\" Executive Decision does ask you to suspend disbelief several times, especially near the end. I would rank it up with Air Force One, which came out a year later and delivers the same type of \"suspense over explosions\" entertainment. And this film deserves extra kudos for making the ones that save the world a bit on the \"misfit\" side (Oliver Platt, John Leguizamo, Joe Morton, BD Wong, and yes, even Kurt Russell). Another nice slimy role for late character actor JT Walsh. And David Suchet makes a scary villain. Like the best villains (Alan Rickman from Die Hard comes to mind), he can be charming and terrifying at the same time.",

This movie opened at number one and out-grossed those action movies.",
    "review": "The First Wives Club, while being an amusing flick, should not and can not be compared to the novel of the same name. As a matter of fact, some of the problems many people have with the film virtually disappear in the novel.Annie Paradise, played by Diane Keaton, is far more annoying on screen than on page. In the film, Annie is anxious, neurotic, and just plain wimpy, in comparison to the novel Annie who happens to be quiet, and somewhat \"over-nice.\" While many find that this film is disturbingly feminist, Annie's actions are far more forgiving in the novel, which has an array of background characters which Annie's husband exploit (While in the movie, all that he does is marry her therapist). This is completely forgotten in the screenplay, where Annie's family of two sons, and a daughter with Down's Syndrome, is now whittled down to one daughter, Chris the Lesbian. One can hardly blame Annie for her actions in the novel, where Aaron Paradise, her ex-husband, favors one son and forgets the other, can never accept his handicap daughter, and steals all of her trust fund and gambles on the stock market, losing it. In the film, she just appears to be an embittered woman.Bette Midler's character of Brenda remains very similar in personality, but very different in sexuality. Her children too, get an overhaul in the novel's transition to film, but since none make much of an appearance in either, this is irrelevant. In the novel, however, Brenda's money problems are much greater, and her anger with Morty who \"welsched\" on her is so great that there's not much of a chance of her wanting to get back together with him -- besides the fact that in the novel, he's in prison, and Brenda realizes, albeit somewhat late in life, that's she's a lesbian. Instead, she gets together with her feminist lawyer who helps her take on Morty.Elise Elliot, played by Goldie Hawn, is the most shocking change of character. Elise Elliot of the film is shallow, vain, and out of work because of her impending age. Elise Elliot (Atchison) of the novel is down-to-earth, classy, intelligent, and battling to enjoy her life while still following her mother's advice of how a wealthy heiress should live. Bill, her husband, commits crimes that are minor compared to the other Wives' husbands - as one of the richest women (by inheritance) in the world, she only asked that Bill would try to give her as normal of a life as possible. Instead, her cheated on her multiple times. Elise gets involved in Bill's downfall very little, however, and he brings it upon himself by falling in love with a self-destructive young woman named Phoebe. While I enjoy both the movie and the book, the comparison is depressing. The film is filled with self-righteous feminism, and is the story of three women who can't seem to handle the fact that their marriages have now ended -- and all men appear to be pigs. The novel is intelligent and funny, and the women only bring justice to their husbands, letting \"the punishment fit the crime.\" Also, in the novel, how a person acted depended on who they were, not their sex. All three Wives find love in new men (or in Brenda's case, women). While watching the First Wives Club, one must remember to take all of it's actions with a grain of salt - it is merely an exaggeration of an idea. The novel is one of justice, and an excellent account of the lives of \"WASPs\" in New York -- don't blame it for how it's been adapted.",

The premise of this comedy is also a solid gold - its kinda takes itself not so serious but the jokes land because its a hilarious story in itself as well characters are superb - for a comedy.Overall, \"Kingpin\" was definitely one of the more memorable comedies from the 90's.

When the inital meeting is turned into a massacre by a misunderstanding surrounding the dove of peace, the camp seeking war seem to have the stronger case.  However the Martian Ambassator apologises and is allowed to meet before the joint houses in the US.  However when the Martians use this as an way to wipe out America's leaders in one move.  Security is stepped up and the world is put on a war footing, however the martians seem only interesting in destruction and death and deliver both with a wickedly cruel sense of humour.We all know that Tim Burton and sci-fi blockbuster movies don't always deliver the goods (planet of the apes anyone?).  This was released in the same summer as Independence Day and ID came off much, much better.  That was mainly because ID gave the people what they wanted - they wanted a little comedy, lots of fancy FX and explosions, nothing different that would cause them to think in any way, and the good guys (the Americans) must win and save the earth!  Burton gave them most of that, but it was just too different!What we have here is a ID style story but it is infused with Burton's manic vision.  This takes away from the blockbuster appeal of the average ID, but it makes it a much funnier, wierder experience.  Some of it doesn't work, Nicholson's multirole performance is nowhere near the standard of Peter Sellers in Dr Strangelove (which he clearly aspires to) and some of the cameos are forced and silly.  However all the stuff with the aliens works really well because it is so OTT and it knows it - Burton just lets his vision run wild.  In place of ID destruction of the white house, we have the aliens knocking down the Easter Island statues like 10 pin bowling etc. Where ID took itself very seriously, Mars Attacks plays like a spoof of the 1950's sci-fi and comes off much better for it.As for the ending - of course it's absurd!  Yes it's a bit of a leap to imagine that the aliens would be defeated in this way, but it doesn't matter because it's all tongue in cheek.  It is no more stupid than ID which sees the aliens destroyed by Goldblum and Smith flying a spaceship (Smith flies it because he's seen one before - the scientists who have been studying it aren't allowed, even though they know how it works), into the core of the mothership, downloading a computer virus from Windows 98 onto the alien system and clearing off!  Both endings are dumb, but at least Mars Attacks doesn't try to cover it up.There are so many actors here that to try and say who does well and who doesn't would take ages.  So here we good.  Good -Nicholson (as the president), Brosnan, Sarah Jessica Parker, MJ Fox, Steiger, Pam Grier, Lukas Haas, Jim Brown and Lisa Marie.  Bad - Glenn Close, De Vito, Short and a pointless \"oh look it's....\" cameo from Tom Jones.  The actors given screen time are good but stars wheeled out for novelty value are a bit wasted generally.Overall this may not be to everyone's tastes.  When it come out everyone seemed to expect another ID style film.  However Burton's mad vision and comic touches make this a very enjoyable spoof.",

    "review": "Maximum Risk is the first US feature film from acclaimed Hong Kong director Ringo Lam with Van Damme as star. He previously brought in John Woo to direct action classic Hard Target, but JCVD and John Woo didn't exactly hit it off creatively. Ringo Lam and JCVD worked well together and would continue to work together on two more films(Replicant and In Hell). Maximum Risk is much different than the movies JCVD normally works on, it is pretty dark, gritty and has less stylish action that he is known for. The film is mostly devoid of humor and is presented in a serious and more realistic manner. Ringo Lam gets Van Damme to focus more on his acting and by the time he works with JCVD next, his acting improves significantly. While the whole twin brother plot has been done to death at this point, JCVD is a cop and must investigate the circumstances of his estranged twin brother's death. Natasha Henstridge is good in this as JCVD's love interest and damsel in distress. I would regard this as more of a thriller than straight up action movie, but as a mash up of genres it does it fairly well. This is also the 1st action movie I seen that involves the Russian mob, which nowadays is common with movies like John Wick, The Equalizer, etc. As a whole this was done well and JCVD would work next with legendary Hong Kong director/producer Tsui Hark on Knock Off which is unfortunate because that movie is a giant turkey of a movie, completely terrible.

But Edward Norton's turn as the \"defendant/victim\" in Primal Fear is one of those \"Wow\" moments that leaves the audience salivating for his next performance. In this feature debut, Norton outdistances his role, as does Richard Gere, in a resurrection no less impressive than Norton's star-making turn. Heretofore, Gere has specialized in assorted intelligent professional cad roles. Here, he gets a chance to inhabit one that not only wears his dubious character on his sleeve, but wears it, drives it, drinks it... revels in it. Yeah, sure somewhere there's a heart of gold, but like his client, the layers on top serve him better, and the heart of gold is tarnished. Gere is at his peak, comfortably, cheerfully inhabiting the role.\nLaura Linney deserves extra credit for often being the ice-queen foil which propels the two male characters' development; her own character is rather one- dimensional, but she herself squeezes as much dazzle as she can from it. Even though everyone else obviously falls for whatever Gere's Vail purrs into their ears, it's merely enough time for Linney's Janet to get a drag on her ubiquitous cigarette; another step in what will (hopefully) someday be film's love affair with her. Wasted, sadly, are fine character actors like John Mahoney, Steven Bauer, Maura Tierney & Andre Braugher who could have lit up the screen had they not been handed scripts with generic character stereotypes.See it to watch the ascension of Norton and Gere.",

    "review": "Raja Hindustani, released in 1996, was a huge blockbuster. It swept nearly all the awards at Filmfare that year and the actors and songs became a sensation.But nowadays people look back and have begun to criticize the film, saying that it is cheesy, over the top, and stuff like that. Sure, it has some faults, like a typical clich\u00e9d Bollywood love story that is up and down, cheesy dialogues, and some quality mistakes. I admit, the story was kind of stupid. But honestly, it's a Bollywood film, so what do you expect. I mean many of Shah Rukh Khan's films have all these things as well, but you don't really see people criticizing those.There were two reasons why I liked this film, and why it entertained me. First, the performances. Karisma Kapoor did pretty good, she danced well, and looked good overall throughout the film. Raja Hindustani also contains one of Aamir Khan's finest performances. One of his underrated ones actually, if you look at it today. He was earnest, likable, he was excellent emotionally, and overall really impressed me. He didn't really overact as SRK does. Besides the performances there was also the music. Who can forget Raja Hindustani's songs? Nadeem-Shravan and singers Kumar Sanu, Alka Yagnik and Udit Narayan did great by singing songs such as Pardesi Padres and Aaye Ho Meri Zindagi Mein. There was also some good comedy throughout the film. Overall, I think Raja Hindustani is a pretty good entertainer, I don't understand why people don't like it anymore.",

As a gift, Wilder gave Thornton a paperback copy of this movie's script with his autograph, and a personal message inscribed on it.",
    "review": "Set in a small, rural Southern town, Billy Bob Thornton's \"Sling Blade\" is so flavorful in ambiance and tone, so rich in character and theme that it's hard to believe that its roots are not to be found in any short story or novel. For while it has all the earmarks of a great work of literature, \"Sling Blade\" is actually an original creation by Thornton, the triple threat talent who wrote, directed and stars in the work.Karl Childers is a marginally retarded man who's been living in a mental institution ever since, as a child, he accidentally stumbled across his mother and her lover in a compromising position and, in a moment of considerable confusion, hacked the two of them to death. After being officially declared by the state to be \"rehabilitated\" and \"cured,\" Karl is thrust back out into the world where he forms a bond with a fatherless boy, his hardworking, compassionate mother and a gay storeowner who has long since become a part of their extended family. Also part of that family is the widow's twisted boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves, who physically and psychologically abuses both mother and son.Thanks to Carl's \"strangeness\" and homicidal background, as well as the simmering volatility and mercurial temperament of Doyle, there is always the threat of violence hanging ominously over the work. Yet, in many ways, \"Sling Blade\" is really about the goodness of people in their willingness to overlook external differences and to find the similarities that unite us all in a common bond of humanity. For the most part, the people in this quiet little community try to reach out and befriend Karl, sensing a decency in him that helps to mitigate any possible fear they might have of him based solely on surface eccentricities. Even when he is eventually forced into violent action, he does so as an avenging angel bringing swift and righteous justice, not as a murderous demon acting out of hatred or malice.The acting in the film - beginning with Thornton himself - could not be more brilliant. With his stooped shoulders, tight-lipped smile, jutting jaw, vacant expression and guttural throat-clearing, Karl became the butt of so many jokes back when the movie first came out that it's easy to forget what a truly amazing character - and job of acting - Thornton has pulled off here. The actor we've known from so many other movies is completely invisible in this role, as he literally becomes Karl in every fiber of his being and, in so doing, forces us to see the wisdom and humanity buried deep inside the person. The performance is such a touchstone of acting for our generation that it is easy to miss all the other great acting in the film, particularly on the part of Natalie Canerday, Lucas Black, John Ritter, J.T. Walsh, Robert Duvall and, most especially, Dwight Yoakam, whose portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of a psychopathic meltdown is bone-chilling and brilliant.As a writer, Thornton has shaped his film like a modern day parable - simple, symbol-laden and allegorical. As a director, he proves himself a master of rhythm and pacing, setting the mood and allowing the scenes to play themselves out without recourse to overstatement or melodrama. In fact, this is one of those rare movies in which every moment feels just right, so confident is Thornton in his ability as a filmmaker to bring his story to life on screen. He also knows how to make the bucolic setting come across as both stark and sensuous at the same time, a place of quiet stillness that provides the perfect backdrop for the morality tale he is endeavoring to tell. Finally, Daniel Lanois has provided a haunting musical score that ever so subtly draws us into the disturbingly offbeat world of the drama.\"Sling Blade\" earned a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for Thornton, but he should also have won awards for his directing and his performance as Karl, not to mention the film itself which should have won the honor as Best Picture of 1996 - although Hollywood, in its infinite wisdom, failed even to nominate it. Ah well, even with that lapse in judgment, \"Sling Blade\" remains one of the great movie dramas of the past decade.",

    "review": "Danny Boyle's \"Trainspotting\" is a film in which everything goes the right way. Few films are fortunate to 'be' at the right time and right place and take the world by storm as \"Trainspotting\" did, but the ultimate proof of this film's greatness is that if you watched it alone or with a large group of people, in 2008 or in 1996, it has the same effect- absolute power. This film is nothing more- or less- than one of the most effective and perfect artistic works ever committed to celluloid.The film follows the lives of a group of drug attics in Scotland in the late 1980's but is constructed less as a conventional narrative and more as a series of vignettes connected by characters and set to the film's dazzling soundtrack (the fact that I mention the scenes being 'set' to the soundtrack is proof of its importance in this particular film). Almost every scene is as powerful as the next, with three montages in particular being possibly the definitive examples of how to do a memorable cinematic montage.Pop culture has been kind to \"Trainspotting\", remembering it as a unique and great film, especially in Britain. I certainly do not disagree with this consensus, but I feel the film has been hurt by familiarity, with even television series like \"Family Guy\" parodying the film's well-known scenes (and badly). This doesn't mean that the film's popularity is being hurt, but that it doesn't feel as fresh and original to people now as it did back in 1996. This is hardly the thing the film's reputation suffers most from however, with the significantly large number of people who claim the film supports and promotes drug use. I have to ask, and forgive my rudeness, how stupid can you possibly be? No, drug addicts in this film are not vilified, but they are consistently shown in a brutally realistic and horrifically tragic context, and just because the film doesn't go out of its way to emotionally manipulate you into completely hating its characters doesn't mean that it promotes drug use, it means that it's a knowing film careful enough not to become a sappy, melodramatic Hollywood product. The acting is phenomenal, the music is terrific, the film is a pitch-perfect example of energizing editing and brilliant use of montage, and its script is one of the best ever written, alternately hilarious, horrifying, tragic, and benefiting from a rare level of depth and resonance. A British classic is what Trainspotting is recognized as, and a British classic is what it is. 10/10",

    "review": "The opening sequence of how other people effect the flow of our natural day opens up the idea to the audience that like the Trigger Effect, other people during the course of our \"normal\" days can end up making us go crazy and even doing some drastic stuff. The Trigger Effect opens up \"Touch of Evil\" style with a wonderful sequence of no name actors who end up playing a huge role on the story line of what the Trigger Effect is. Almost by mistake, we are brought into the lives of the main characters, and from there the story begins. The movie holds some amazing moments and some excellent scenes with the 3 leads. Still, the movie falls short with an ending, nobody wanted to see. A thriller that builds and builds and builds and goes nowhere. The struggle between the characters grow and then end up going off on a detour and nothing else. Sad, the movie could have been a timeless story how the slightest things in our day could end up killing ourselves if not killing others. The story was terrific and could have been an excellent movie. But overall, the movie is worth watching just for the moments it has.",

    "review": "Power Rangers Turbo was alright. The movie wasn't as good as the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Movie. Neither was the season. Even if i was only 8 years old when this season came out, I did watch every episode of the original Mighty Morphin with the original cast and everything. I loved it when i was little. I never watched much TV and that was the only show i watched really on a daily basis. I would ask my parents to record it for me if i was gonna miss it, and bought one of the tapes and watched it over and over again. Now after watching this season, i never wanted to watch power rangers again. I've seen some of the newer ones that have come out now (i have a younger cousin that watches it sometimes) and its just horrible. Fox used to own the rights to Power Rangers, now Disney does, and they seriously need to come out with the original Mighty Morphin on DVD. I'm considering not letting my kids, when i have kids, watch the newer versions of Power Rangers because they are so pointless. If Disney doesn't come out with the original on DVD available in the US, then none of the kids will know how good the original one, and thats the only ones my kids would be allowed to watch. If you ask me, they should put the original episodes back on the TV during the day, not at 11 at night on Jedix.",

However with the terrorists making great demands and starting to kill hostages on the plane the President has to make contact with the ground but also take on the terrorists.It's not an original idea \u0096 Die Hard on a plane.  But hang on we've done Die Hard on a plane at least a few times in Passenger 57 and Executive Decision so how can we do it again?  By putting it on air force one of course.  So the President becomes John McClane and Gary Oldman is the usual Brit playing Euro-trash terrorist.  The difference between this and Die Hard is that here the action is a lot more stilted and underplayed \u0096 which is a surprise for an action movie.  However it does manage to have a good tension so it's still good.It adds interest by having the action in the ground along with the political fighting in the White House over control of the situation.  It isn't an earth shattering script but it is good enough to get you carried away easily.  The only downside is that you can nearly always see where the formula is going at any one time.The cast is good and is deep.  Ford has the age to play a President but the action status to give him that fighting edge.  Oldman is no stranger to hamming up his bad guys and doing iffy accents and here turns in a so-so performance as a cartoon terrorist.  The support cast is good \u0096 even if they have little to do.  Glenn Close, Dean Stcokwell et al don't have much to do but talk loud but do it well.  Macy, Berkeley, Prochnow and other big names add weight but have few lines.Overall this is a big Hollywood blockbuster that no doubt helped America feel good about itself.  It sticks close to the formula but the action is slick and quite tense and makes for an enjoyable, if unoriginal, 2 hours.",

    "review": "Being Saturday evening (comedy night in our house),my wife and I sat down to watch a supposedly funny movie called \"Boogie Nights\". The only thing I had heard about it was that my sister-in-law told us not to see it because it was bawdy and she walked out, so right away I knew it was worth watching. This movie was nothing like we thought it was going to be like--it was a fantastic and quite involving drama, which deserved a few Oscars. The time frames from the early 70's to the mid 80's were flawless, and the \"glamor\" of the porn industry was effectively dispelled by the portrayal of the stars. One of the most memorable scenes of all times, in my opinion was the drug deal gone bad, the firecrackers, the guy in the bathrobe and the utter uneasiness of the deposed porn stars as we listened to \"Jessie's Girl\" and \"Sister Christian\". Burt Reynolds was great as Jack Horner, the director who made money with young energy and the coming trends, but realized he had to be \"father\" to all those aging stars who had nowhere else to go once the bright lights began to flicker and the money was getting thin.",

I missed out on it's significance and even it's cultural importance. I was admittedly thrown off by Joey Lauren Adam's voice, i saw it as distracting and I had to get over it, something like that shouldn't hinder the viewer but it did for me and it played a factor the first time watching.Her and the rest of the cast are great. She is brilliant as Alyssa with a lot of gut impacting scenes. Ben Affleck and Jason Lee star opposite to her. Affleck is convincing and Lee is immaculate as Affleck's best friend, roommate and comic book artist who has a lot of memorable moments as a side character.The theme of the movie might've been a bit groundbreaking for it's time as it explores sexual endeavours of the triangle between the 3 characters. The curiosity is compelling and it works and the best part is, it leaves the questions without solidarity answers. All this, and it still manages to feel like Kevin Smith's movie - lots of crude jokes and comedic value.Just behind the Clerks series and maybe Zack and Miri, Chasing Amy is absolutely worth seeing.",

Liberal thought and freedom from all pre-made and superimposed thought is a subject that I never saw treated in such an open manner, especially in a conservative society like the Egyptian one. The Camera playing, the lighting modules, the music, the positioning of the right song in the right situation are all points that count on the director's side. The scene where the Khaleefa says: \"I'm the Andalus\" with him being zoomed out to appear dotted in the centre of the screen, is one scene that I don't think will forget.

    "review": "Disaster movies can be a fun way to spend some time idle, although most are not particularly cinematically remarkable. This movie fits that description well. The action takes place in a small rural village that has just been considered a great place to live in the US, but lives in the shadow of a sleeping volcano. What no one knows is that this volcano appears to be in full swing and threatens to explode.The movie quickly creates tension among the audience, and it serves well to grab our attention. I am not the best person to judge the script's ability to be true to the scientific facts underlying a volcanic eruption, I just accept what I saw tacitly, but I admit the possibility the film is not very true to science. The initial half is slower and the action is concentrated on the final half, which is basically a race to escape the volcano. There are some loose ends and inconsistent details, like that scene where a girl, who doesn't even reach the car's pedals, can drive off in a 4-4 jeep.Pierce Brosnan was convincing in his starring role, while Linda Hamilton made an effort but is always in his shadow. Either way, they are the ones who leverage the movie. The volcano, as it happens in such cases, is almost a character in its own right. Technically, the film was entitled to the best sound and special effects that existed in 1997... but the quick advances in film make it look old-fashioned to many today. Personally, I liked what I saw.It's not an excellent movie and it's far from being the life movie of anyone involved, it has a dubious script and unbelievable scenes where (as always happens in these movies) some characters escapes from death by a hair. But it's still one of the best disaster movies of the late 1990s, it's fun and entertains the public well.",

    "review": "On one level, \"Donnie Brasco\" might just look like another mafia movie. But it's not. It tells the story of FBI agent Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp), who in the late 1970s was hired to infiltrate the mafia. So, he got acquainted with hit-man Benjamin \"Lefty\" Ruggiero (Al Pacino). But lo and behold, Joe got too much into the mafia lifestyle, to the point where it dominated his life and kept him from his family. And no one ended up with a very good reward at the end.Both Depp and Pacino are about as intense as we expect them to be, with good support from Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, James Russo, Anne Heche and Zeljko Ivanek. With his hair all greased back, Depp looks like the ultimate mafioso. I should identify that there are two scenes that will probably make your skin crawl: the leg scene, and what they do to the Japanese waiter.But don't get me wrong. This is a really good movie. It's certainly a less glamorized view of mafia life than most of Al Pacino's movies, and Johnny Depp was certainly showing the same flair for acting that he has brought to the screen for the past 16 years. Very well done.",

I am a Canadian married to a Portuguese lady so a number of these differences I have experienced first hand. For example, when you meet the \"family\" it is not just three or four people it is half the town. Also when you sit in the sun all day, some people tend to melt (I do) and others do not. In the movie, I also found her father's line \"Presbyterian is not a religion\" a nice summary of why the parents didn't think the marriage could work.The movie has nice scenery of the grand canyon, the hoover dam, the desert and the great grandmother's Mexican \"casa\". The surround sound is very enjoyable. It includes a great many songs all of which blend in nicely with the movie. The Elvis songs near the end of the movie are quite touching.Finally the two leads are sensational. Matthew Perry's body language is superb for the kind of light comedy role he plays. He also did the emotional stuff really well. Although not quite certain about his feelings, his heart pulled him head-first into marriage.Salma is very cute and her tan does her wonders. She also is a good actress and adds a lot to the humor.I've seen this movie six times in the last year. It is a nice relaxing watch.",

    "review": "Where does a director go after making two colossal worldwide hits?\"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992) and \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) were two of the greatest movies ever made, and they launched director Quentin Tarantino into the realm of Mainstream Hollywood Director. Most of the time, a director faced with this reality will sink into a slew of really bad movies, but so far Tarantino has been either extremely lucky or extremely talented - his third feature film, although lacking in the brutality of its predecessors, contains just as much wit. Based upon the Elmore Leonard novel \"Rum Punch,\" it's packed with the clever dialogue that Leonard is known for in his writing. It's also got a good amount of style, too. It's not a typical Tarantino movie, but is that necessarily a bad thing? In this particular instance, no.Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a flight stewardess forced into running jobs for Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), a ruthless criminal who has no respect for life - or death, for that matter. However, during one of her smuggling efforts, a couple of FBI Agents (including Michael Keaton) nab her and offer her a deal: If she helps them get Ordell, she will be let free from custody. The Feds do not know who Ordell is, but they know he exists, and that is where Jackie comes in. She reluctantly agrees to participate in their sting operation, but all is not what it seems. And when $500,000 dollars disappears from his retirement fund, Ordell stops, thinks, and arrives upon the conclusion that we all anticipate with glee: Jackie Brown did it.His partner in crime, Louis (the wonderful Robert De Niro), also decides to double-cross Ordell, with the help of a sexy blonde ditz named Melanie (Bridget Fonda), The movie's twisting plot line and intersecting story lines is very reminiscent of \"Pulp Fiction,\" and De Niro's underrated performance is a real stand-out. The movie's quite well made and enjoyable.Don't misinterpret what I'm saying. This is no \"Reservoir Dogs,\" nor does it want to be. It's not in the same vein as Tarantino's other movies, at least not at a superficial level. However, it is extremely entertaining, helped along by a great cast and a terrific script. The only difference here is that Tarantino did not come up with everything by himself. He adapted the screenplay from another source, something he usually doesn't do. But there's also a little-known fact that Roger Avary co-wrote some of \"Dogs\" and \"Fiction\" with Tarantino, as well as sparked the idea for some of his films. Here, Quentin adapts Leonard's novel and does justice. People who say it isn't as good as his other movies because it's recycled obviously don't know what they're talking about.Tarantino started out as a video store clerk, and is the movie buff's filmmaker. Not only does Tarantino share a deep passion for films, but he also knows what most of the real movie enthusiasts want. He has yet to disappoint me with any of his directorial efforts. His own life story would make an interesting movie, and indeed it did with \"True Romance,\" partially based on Tarantino's own self-image of himself. (A geek working at a comic book store falls in love and goes off of an adventure into a new realm -- in Tarantino's own case, it was film-making. For Clarence, from \"True Romance,\" it was drugs and murder.)Tarantino has a flair for raw energy in all of his films, and \"Jackie Brown\" is no exception. The movie is bursting at its edges, packed with wild antics and the occasional fierce brutality. The movie was criticized by Tarantino's die-hard fans for being too different from his other films. However, the mistake of many directors is to repeat the same formulas over and over again. One must at least give Tarantino credit for trying new things in each of his films. If anything, the only thing that Tarantino likes to insert into all his films is a large source of energy. And is that a bad thing?4.5/5 stars.",

    "review": "Jack Nicholson is one of those actors who impresses me the second (and I'm not overstating in the least bit) he appears on screen.  The moment I see Jack's face on screen, I get this feeling that everything's going to be all right.  He could do a Pauly Shore film, and elevate its quality with his mere presence.  And I didn't even get to his acting.Nicholson won a well-deserved Oscar for this movie.  Then again, I feel like he deserves an Oscar for virtually everything he's been in.  Hell, you can even give him an Oscar nod for \"Anger Management.\"  THAT'S how great he is! He's one of those actors who can communicate even more emotion when he's not saying anything than when he is.  And of course, he has one of the coolest movie star voices ever, so it makes it a joy whenever he does speak.  I still feel like \"You can't handle the truth!\" wouldn't be as priceless a line if Jack didn't yell it.  He can say almost any line of dialogue and turn it into gold.  In this movie it was \"You make me wanna be a better man.\"  Again, an otherwise forgettable line of dialogue made gold by Jack.\n\"As Good As It Gets\" is a flawed film, with scenes that drag and an overlong running time, but it's highly enjoyable and altogether pretty well-written. Aside from its many hilarious moments, it's also quite touching.  But I have to admit that it's the comedy that sticks out most in my memory.  There's some priceless gags like when a Jewish couple is sitting at Jack's usual table.  He first intrudes into their conversation saying, \"People who speak in metaphors oughtta shampoo my crotch.\"  He complains to Helen Hunt, his usual waitress, saying \"I have Jews at my table!\"  He then intrudes in the couple's conversation again, noticing the food on their table, saying \"Obviously your appetites aren't as big as your noses.\"  Now, I probably wouldn't want to personally know a man like Melvin in my real life, but I still found those cracks to be hysterically funny.  The same when he attacks Greg Kinnear's gay character with constant homosexual slurs.\nThe performances are great all-around.  Though Jack pretty much steals the show, Greg Kinnear gives a wonderfully endearing performance.  He doesn't play out the gay stereotypes, yet he's sensitive and feminine enough to have me convinced that he is gay (unlike Eric McCormack on \"Will and Grace\" who acts like he's gay for the sake of the show's gimmick).  It's nice to see Kinnear rise from the host of \"Talk Soup\" and the thankless late night talk show \"Later\" to a fine actor.  Previously, I wouldn't have any notion that he could become what he is now.  Helen Hunt also gives a compelling, emotionally packed performance.  And Shirley Knight, as her mother, provides a little bit of comic relief.  Cuba Gooding Jr. has a small but interesting role, and he makes the best of it.The film does have its dull moments, but Jack's one-of-a-kind performance makes it all worthwhile.  There is nobody, and I mean NOBODY, who could've played Melvin better than him.  I read in the trivia that John Travolta was originally offered the role.  Now, I like Travolta, but in this type of role he wouldn't hold a candle to Jack.My score:  7 (out of 10)",

    "review": "Wes Craven is back again at the helm of Scream 2, his followup to the mega-successful Scream. As sequels go, one could do a lot worse than this film. Sure, it has a pretty silly story trying desperately to cling to the original source material, but it never ever takes the story too terribly serious. How does Craven do this? He laces the film with all kinds of film references and humour directly tied to the film industry and actors involved. Several mentions of \"Friends\" cast members abound whilst having Courtney Cox return in her signature role as Gail Weathers. Craven also brings back the rules to horror films - now horror sequels; these rules are right on mark too(wish we had heard the most important!). In fact my favourite scene in the whole movie is in a classroom where students debate the inferior sequel to the superior original. Excellent examples are given to support one argument that sequels are better: Aliens and Terminator 2, and of course, The Godfather 2. Naturally this small cross section seems great when none of the hundreds of truly bad sequels are mentioned. Purposely I am sure! Is Scream 2 better than Scream? No way. It doesn't have nearly as much punch to it. The opening scene this time takes place in a movie theater, but it is not as powerful as the opening scene with Drew Barrymore in the original. The story is really something unto itself as well...but any kind of examination of plot other than a cursory one would give too much away. Not that that would be any great pity. I did like the acting in this one more. Arquette returns as Dewey affecting some kind of limp and pinched nerve in hand. He does a fairly nice job. Cox is lovely as ever and also is good in her role. Campbell is OK, as is the rest of the cast with Jamie Kennedy again standing out as nerdy movie maven Randy Weeks and, in particular, Liev Screiber doing a wonderful job as Cotton Weary(the man who had been accused of killing Sidney's mama). This sequel has more blood, more deaths, and more jokes. Like the original, I too enjoyed this film for its entertainment value if nothing else.",

    "review": "This is like Backdraft in Chinese. We follow a group of firemen at a big fire station as they struggle with their loved ones, their bosses, making sense of it all, and of course with fires. The film spends the first 35 min. setting up the character and the story, before you even see the first fire. But this means that once you see the fire, you actually care about those involved in it. Around 60 min. into the story, the firemen arrive at a blazing warehouse, where the rest of the film takes place, as they fight with other stations trying to get the `fire of the decade' under control, and save the civilians trapped inside. I was impressed with the fire sequences in Backdraft when it came out, but this blew me away. There aren't as many fire-scenes as in Backdraft, but they are far more realistic, more often than not resembling the clips you might have seen of actual firemen at work. And what's even more surprising is that it's the actual actors performing the stunts (the DVD contains a small featurette that clearly shows this)! Even when the characters are being helplessly engulfed in flames, as they are running for their lives, it's still them! And I'm not talking about quick cuts, no, you this in slow motion: The actor running, the fire going faster, the fire catching up and swallowing the actor, and just when you think it's all over: the actor, with (apparently) the last breath, jumping clear of the flames and to safety. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone who loves Chinese/Cantonese cinema, but also to everybody else. Because this this is a well shot, well acted, well written film, that - in terms of describing the lives of firefighters - are far more",

    "review": "In a future society, the military component does not have to recruit; rather, their candidates are chosen at birth, culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government. They are given over to the war machine, body and soul, for no reason other than to protect and serve; they have no personal identity other than a name and rank, and no autonomy whatsoever.  This is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in `Soldier,' directed by Paul Anderson and starring Kurt Russell.  The scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time, from   preadolescence to adulthood.  Russell is Sergeant Todd, the best of the best, and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign; he is what he was born to be, a soldier.  But even the best cannot go on forever, and the day arrives when Todd and his peers are no longer the elite.  A new generation of soldiers has been created, products of advanced genetics and technology, and Todd's generation is suddenly obsolete.  What follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life, while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality, traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life:  Fear and discipline. \tRussell gives a commanding performance as Todd, the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts.  He has few lines in this movie, but Russell speaks volumes with his eyes.  This role demonstrates that he is, in fact, one of the under-appreciated actors of our times; that he can disappear so entirely into the character of Todd is a credit to his ability, and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he's done before.  And he's given Todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype.  Notable performances are also turned in here by Connie Nielsen (Sandra) and Jason Isaacs (Colonel Mekum).  Rounding out the supporting cast are Jason Scott Lee, memorable as Caine 607, one of the new generation of soldiers; Sean Pertwee (Mace); Gary Busey (Captain Church); Michael Chiklis (Jimmy Pig); and Mark Bringleson (Rubrick). \tAnderson has delivered an action film with a message, a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science-fiction.  `Soldier' reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact.  It's an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives, like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldn't make a whole lot of difference.  Much like `1984,' and `Mad Max,' this movie, which is ultimately uplifting, is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of Universe in which we all must live together and share.  I rate this one 7/10.",

    "review": "One of the standard received ideas of film criticism is to say that sequels are almost never as good as the original film. (There are also a few standard exceptions to this rule, such as 'The Godfather Part 2' and the second and third parts of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy). Subject to these exceptions, however, there seems to be a law of diminishing returns to the effect that the more sequels a franchise spawns, the worse they become. The Bond films, however, seem to me to provide the most striking exception to this principle. The franchise started with 'Dr No' in the early sixties, and 'Tomorrow Never Dies' amounts to 'James Bond XVIII', or 'James Bond XIX' if one includes 'Never Say Never Again' in the total. Despite this, one can watch the latest offerings with as much pleasure as the original Sean Connery films from the sixties and seventies. The Bond films are highly formulaic. They typically start with an action sequence before the opening credits that has little or nothing to do with the film that is to follow. The main story will involve Bond thwarting a dastardly plot by some megalomaniac bent on world domination. It will always involve at least one extended chase sequence, and possibly two or more. The main character, apart from Bond and the villain, will always be a beautiful young woman who helps Bond in his quest and who will end up by falling for him. There will always be at least one other beautiful girl, either as a secondary heroine or as a villainess. The villain will always have a small army of henchmen ready to do battle on his behalf. The story will always end with a shoot-out, normally in the villain's headquarters, in which Bond manages to avert the threatened disaster at the last minute.'Tomorrow Never Dies' contains all these formulaic elements. It is, nevertheless, in my view one of the better entries in the Bond canon, for a number of reasons beyond the fact that Pierce Brosnan is the best Bond since Connery. These can be summarised as follows:-1. The Villain. Jonathan Pryce plays Elliott Carver, a newspaper and media tycoon intent on whipping up a war between Britain and China. The reason is to facilitate the accession to power of his ally, a renegade Chinese general who has promised to give his organisation exclusive broadcasting rights in China. Bond villains have always provided scope for some splendidly over-the-top displays of acting, going back to Lotte Lenya's Rosa Klebb and Gert Frobe's Goldfinger. Although Pryce's Carver is more restrained than some, it falls within this tradition. At first sight the silver-haired bespectacled Carver seems mild-mannered and soft spoken, but soon reveals the raving megalomania which is the hallmark of the Bond villain. Particularly noteworthy is the speech where Carver states his ambitions as being 'power' and 'world domination'. Although he puts a liberal, metaphorical interpretation on these two concepts, the audience is left in no doubt that he means what he says quite literally. There is also a good performance from Gotz Otto as Carver's brutal German henchman, Stamper.2. The Girl. Admittedly, Teri Hatcher is rather wasted as the secondary Bond girl Paris Carver, Elliott's wife and a former girlfriend of Bond. Michelle Yeoh, however, is superb as the main female lead, the Chinese secret agent Wai Lin. (That's how it's spelled, although the pronunciation used in the film suggests that the name should actually be transliterated as Wei Lin). Apart from Michelle's striking looks, she is also an accomplished martial arts performer, and her skills are put to good use in this film. (Part of a trend of giving Bond girls a more active role, in contrast to the earlier films in the series where they were required to do little other than look decorative.) 3. The Chase Sequence. The main one, in which Bond and Wai Lin escape on a motorbike through the streets of Hanoi from the villains in a helicopter, is excellent. 4. The Opening Sequence. As usual, this has little to do with the main plot line. It does, however, fit in with a growing tendency in the Bond films, that of mocking or undermining the militaristic, macho values which the series was once accused of promoting. This film introduces a new comic character, the gung-ho, blustering Admiral Roebuck, a sort of naval equivalent of Colonel Blimp, who clashes with the more liberal 'M', the female chief of the British Secret Service. (I was interested to learn that the actors who play them, Geoffrey Palmer and Judi Dench, are husband and wife in real life). In the opening sequence, Bond narrowly prevents Roebuck's blundering attempt to bomb a gathering of international terrorists from setting off a nuclear explosion. The more active roles for female characters are also part of the trend towards a politically correct Bond, as is, perhaps, his remark that smoking is a 'filthy habit'. (The earlier films were often criticised for glamorising the habit by making Bond himself a smoker). As with all the Bond films, one can probably pull holes in the plot of 'Tomorrow Never Dies'. (The scene where Carver sinks a British warship by cutting a hole in the side with what looks like a giant chainsaw struck me as particularly implausible. What's wrong with a torpedo?) Nevertheless, the Bond films are not meant to be works of social realism and unlike, say, the novels of John Le Carre, have never purported to give an accurate picture of life in the British Secret Service. 'Tomorrow Never Dies' is a good example of what the Bond films have always been- superior escapist entertainment. 7/10",

    "review": "All of the characters were well developed and entertaining. This movie never pretended to be anything more than it was..a fun, wacky comedy with a bizarre plot. Anyone who beats this up for being dumb should be taken out back and paddled. It is obvious THEY are too dumb to realize that this was DESIGNED to be dumb. Anyway..there are too many scenes that I STILL laugh at today, even though I have seen this 1/2 dozen times. So, if you are looking for the greatest film ever made on all levels..give this a pass..if you can relate to the humor, it's a wonderful hoot! I am not a die hard Adam Sandler fan, but I think he scored a 10 in this one for likability and laughs.",

    "review": "American History X is a movie of its own. It has a little bit of everything in the way it touches you. This of course making it a very though provoking film. There isn't a genre you can place this film in because it is a not a crime story, action or even a simple drama instead it is a humanistic thriller. What it is about, is the battle over ourselves.Who better than to display these wild but common complexities within people than Edward Norton. The range he shows here is astounding in only his fifth movie. Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a skin head that realizes through cruel yet necessary events in his life that he has gone down the wrong path. When he comes out of jail he attempts to stop his brother played Edward Furlong from going down the same road he had done. Through all his efforts though some things just prove to be inevitable. Avery Brooks also gives a great performance as Derek Vinyard's former teacher and now principal of his former school. His words may not be of the most inspiring but his actions and messages sent across are subtle yet strong and to the point.Norton's performance though wasn't just about range but exploring different dimensions of life. Whether it proved to be psychological, social or even political on a certain level. It is a transforming performance revealing something mind blowing and eye opening. That we, and this includes anyone, can take a devastating turn in life no matter how intelligent we are or thoughtful. That the person that determines the outcome of your life is yourself whether it is good or bad. Norton's realizations aren't through teachings such as the ones that got him in jail but they are through the events in the time he spent in jail. He saw the truth for himself realizing then what is false and what is real.The screenplay written by David McKenna is about as versatile as the performance Norton gives. Not only because of the Derek Vinyard character but because of the characters involved in his life. For example the root of his evil did not come from the murder of his father but rather his father himself. Through just a conversation at breakfast did his negative thoughts get really embedded eventually then leading to them dramatically taking over his mind and way of life. Only when his father got killed did these negative thoughts seem justified. The way this screenplay and direction was able to display this message in just a plethora of other underlying tones was spectacular.What makes this movie great though is that you can truly find yourself in the messages delivered. As much as the main character might not seem relevant or connected to many people it his emotions and functioning of his mind that all of us are able to connect with. Yet what makes a movie great is not simply the message or messages sent across but how powerfully they are delivered. American History X delivers its multiple and intertwining messages about as powerfully as I've seen from a film.",

    "plot": "In the book, Hunter S. Thompson listens to \"Sympathy For The Devil\" by The Rolling Stones. The rights to play it in the film were too expensive for the production's budget.",
    "review": "When you start watching this movie, you'll decide if you like it or not. But if you don't want to wait, I'll tell you. This movie is so trippy, so gross, so insane, so bizarre, and so friggin' crazy! Now with that said, it's also brilliant, funny, surreal, dark, entertaining etc. The story goes like this; a Dr. Journalism, Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp), and his wolf man attorney, Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro), are sent to Las Vegas to cover a Mint 400 motorcycle race but end up abandoning that in search of the American Dream. The two characters are out of their minds on drugs the entire time which is where the surreal factor comes into play. The film is based the famous novel by Hunter S. Thompson, which was based on real life events he experienced. I'm not kidding when I say that five minutes into this movie and you'll feel that someone drugged your drink or something. This is more than just a movie, it's an experience, and an experience like no other. If you haven't read the book or don't know what your getting yourself into, then you're gonna have one hell of a ride. Johnny Depp (of course) nails the performance of the character that the book created. What director, Terry Gilliam, did is take the book and match the images that we thought of while reading it, perfectly. Throughout the film, watching the two characters wander witlessly around Las Vegas tripping on acid, I felt like I was part of the experience. Also, Depp's performance is so good, that I started to forget that he wasn't really Hunter S. Thompson. The characters are both psychotic but in different ways. Raoul Duke has one foot in reality and another foot in a pit of madness, Gonzo, however, is off his rocker. He's just a ticking atom bomb ready to go off, I'd be scared to stay in the same room as him. But what keeps this movie going strong is the narration by Depp. Some of it's recited from the book but other times it's whatever's on his mind. Without the narration, the movie would be just one wacky thing after another. Overall, watching this movie is like being hit by a car, sucked into a tornado, spat out into a trampoline factory, raped by a wild tiger, eaten by Godzilla, thrown off the face of the Earth, and plummeting right down on the TV. Any negative reviews you may have heard about this movie make no sense. They love the book while hate the film for being so crazy and shapeless (oh, you mean exactly like the book). This is a perfect adaptation of the book. So great performances, surreal scenery, flowing narration, and a clever cameo by Thompson himself. When I first saw this movie, I liked it just fine. I've seen a few more times and every time I see it, it gets better. Now it's gotten to the point where I think it's one of the best films ever made. So if you're a Johnny Depp fan, or a Terry Gilliam fan, or a Hunter S. Thompson fan, or just in the mood for something different and I mean REALLY different, definitely check it out.",

    "review": "Martin Campbell sure knows how to make entertaining movies. After making \"No Escape\" and \"GoldenEye\" he brings us yet another entertaining movie; \"The Mask of Zorro\". He actually used to be one of my favorite directors after seeing those movies I just named but unfortunately he hasn't made anything good lately. Let's hope this change after completing \"Zorro 2\" that is currently being made.\"The Mask of Zorro\" is just some good old fashioned fun with lot's of spectacular moments, good choreographed fight sequences, a love story and a good old fashioned stereotype villain.The story is told in a good way which I think is mainly thanks to Campbell's directing. The pace is high and the combination between the action, the characters and their relations, romance and some of the comical moments is done very well, unlike some other movies from the same genre.There is some nice cinematography that help to create a good atmosphere along with the musical score from James Horner. The end fight is good and it has a spectacular big explosion in it that'll make you go; Wow!Great entertainment for the whole family.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

I loved their clothes and their hair looked great.  Since then I've seen this movie a million times!One of the things I liked best about this movie is that it really WAS tastefully done.  There was virtually no swearing in it, and no sex scenes (which disgust me).  It almost seems like they were discouraging vulgarity...I had to respect Chris Kattan when his 'one night stand' (Eliza Donovan) said \"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Joanie loves Chachi.  But does Chachi give a flying - f*** about Joanie?\"  He kind of looked at her and made a face that showed he was turned off by her language.I would actually feel comfortable enough to let my 2 year old see it (which she has and she's decided she has a crush on 'Crissattan'.)The boys come from a close-knit family with money.  But somehow, they don't see any of it.  They look nice when they go out and it's cool to see brothers who are so close.  Will Ferrell is a tremendous talent. The music is AWESOME! :)I cannot STAND Molly Shannon.  I don't even understand how she got on SNL in the first place.  She is just AWFUL.  She's unattractive, perverted, and all of her characters on SNL just seem to be the same.In all, this was a terrific movie.  I loved it!

    "review": "Okay. They rewrote the whole legend. But Disney has an unerring way of doing that. Anyone remember Pocahontas? They even changed Cinderella, Snow White, and every other Disney Masterpiece sitting on your shelves, so why does it matter that this, too, was changed?It matters on several different levels, but the most important reason it matters is because Disney, in their positioning among the children's entertainment market, is in the unique position to actually teach these legends, these snippets of history, these morals and ethics, to the children of their audiences, rather than proffering sugar-coated, merchandized over-glorifications in exchange for the great American dollar. That having been said, this is still an entertaining introduction to the legend, but I highly suggest \"Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes,\" (1984), directed by Hugh Hudson. It is the most faithful adaptation I've ever seen, and a highly enjoyable adventure, which carries a PG rating and is safe for most ages to view.A lot has been said about the deep canvas effect used throughout the jungle scenes, and I must admit that I found the technique highly effective and extremely well done. I do computer graphics myself, and I was very impressed with the 3D effects throughout, including the water variants and textures used in the ship scenes, the fire effects used in the jungle, and the smoke effects from the guns used by the poachers. The textures and backgrounds were absolutely stunning, and for me, as a graphics artist, that's what I look for when I view a quality animation.Very good endeavor.It rates an 8/10 from...the Fiend :.",

This was the first serious movie I saw featuring Williams, and I was amazed. I had thought Williams would be the type who could only act decently in comedies, but this one proved me wrong. He can put down a serious character with all ease not only that, he can truly touch you with his oh so tear-jerking lines.My conclusion: if you are planning on watching this movie, keep your tissues at hand, and some food and drinks as well since the movie isn't exactly what you call short.",

I really wasn't sure what to expect out of this sequel but the very, very, very last thing I did expect was something boring. I must admit that I was really shocked to see how bland and downright bad this movie was as sadly it's yet another example of a sequel to a good movie being about nothing more than money. The original film was smart, clever and funny in regards to the subject matter but this sequel just lacks any sort of originality and it's really nothing more than a copy of the original. What's so sad is that there could have been so many good and interesting story ideas but sadly we're just given a copy of the first film and we even get many of the same jokes. It's funny to think that the jokes worked so well the first time but here they're just annoying and unfunny. I think the majority of the blame has to go towards the screenplay, which is just a mess. It's never funny, never makes too much sense and sadly it's clear that very little went into it. The performances outside of Tommy Lee Jones really aren't all that memorable either. Lara Flynn Boyle has no problems looking sexy but her character is bland. Rip Torn isn't given much to do and the same is true for Johnny Knoxville and Rosario Dawson. The incredibly bad love story with Dawson is just an embarrassment.

It's his only chance to redeem himself of his past sins, to mend his relationship with his estranged daughter and father-in-law. The story isn't derived from a novel concept but 'Chamatkar' is treated with sincerity. Some may argue that the movie has a dated feel but for me it was fun to watch how people used to dress during the early 90s in India. I liked most of the songs but the fashion show sequence was unintentionally funny, especially how the backup dancers performed and the way they dressed. Naseeruddin Shah is fantastic as Marco the ghost. Who says this man can't do comedy? The same question can be asked about Shahrukh Khan and Urmila Matondkar. It was really great to see these three actors, whose comedic flair is underrated, work together and make something so funny. Khan is stupendous as the good hearted but gullible school teacher and Matondkar is adorable and vivacious as Marco's daughter and Sunder's girlfriend. They make quite a cute pair and I wonder why these two highly talented actors have never worked together again. Of the supporting cast, Shammi Kapoor stands out. 'Chamatkar' doesn't have the highly advanced special effects and style that could perhaps make it more visually appealing but that didn't bother me because there was plenty of other things that was enough to enjoy this movie.",

    "review": "This show suffers from what people refer to as the Saban Touch, but even if it does have poor effects and tired stories, it did serve as a fun, unique installment in the TMNT franchise.  It may not be better than the old show, it's certainly not better than the new one, and the first two movies could be considered leaps ahead of this, but for a group of people who like their cheesy monster men made of rubber and silly fun, this show does bring out the inner child. Besides, the writing was good and funny, the voices of the characters worked well, and the action was a cut above other Saban series.  It's darker than Power Rangers, but still completely child friendly. While many complain about Venus, I thought she was a good addition, if only for that show.  She added a fun element that many TMNT fans secretly thought should be there, which was a female turtle.  I mean, come on, what fanboy could honestly hate a CUTE ninja turtle? :) Anyway, this show should probably be considered an acquired taste for older fans, and for the PR generation more of the same stuff that still passes for Saturday morning action fare.",

    "review": "Wow, Blink 182, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Seth Green, Tupac RIP references, Dharma (but not Greg) {Jenna Elfman}, that guy with the high pitched voice from Empire Records (Ethan Embry) and OMGZ!!! is that the little kid from Hook (1991) all grown up (Charles Korsmo)? Looks like this one's about the late 90s, and it's a decent example of a prime vintage.I can't really explain the nostalgic value of seeing Jerry O'Connell drop in for a cameo, seeing Selma Blair get hit on by Mike Dexter, seeing Sabrina herself Melissa Joan Hart run around like a kid with ADHD and seeing Breckin Meyer ask us if \"Anyone ordered a Love Burger?\" But it is magic. And if you look really carefully, there's Jaime Pressley and Jason Segel, present at the role call as well. When they were making this film they were looking for more than a fast hit, casting some popular young actors in a clich\u00e9d situation involving a party after the last day of High School. They made a film that encapsulated the time perfectly. Not just the fashions and attitudes, but the way movies were being made, and the way popular culture viewed the world. This movie was accurate to the time by showing its characters to be shallow, materialistic and oblivious. It didn't have anything to say about 90s teen culture, but caught what it was. While I don't give the film credit for its clich\u00e9d characterizations, I do give it credit for the way these clich\u00e9s engage with each other into a coherent, though predictable whole.The main story being told involves Amanda Beckett, who has just been dumped by her jock boyfriend Mike Dexter. Nerdy classmate Preston Meyers, flanked by his nerdy friend Denise Fleming, decides that this is the night, at the end of High School Party, to confess his love for Amanda. And that's pretty much it. There are a lot of subplots and minor characters but it all happens around the main narrative.Ethan Embry, as Meyers, is pretty funny, Korsmo, as a vengeful nerd seeking revenge on Mike Dexter for a life time of cruel pranks is actually pretty good. Lauren Ambrose is decent as Denise, but her character is annoying and quite hypocritical. Most of the cast come across well in limited screen time, and some good cameos and funny scenes fort the trailer, with a theme by Smashmouth \"I can't get Enough of you Baby,\" and it was a minor hit at the time it came out.More than a decade later, Can't Hardy Wait is the ultimate nostalgia fix. It looks like a 90s movie, follows all the conventions of a 90s movie and is made like a 90s movie. Not intelligent, but still entertaining. I'll admit a personal bias, but still recommend it if you are a fan of the era.",

    "review": "\"Rounders\" is about a straight-flying legal student (Matt Damon) who leaves behind his gambling habits to satisfy his moralistic girlfriend. However when his best friend \"Worm\" (Edward Norton) is released from jail, the two embark on a cards-journey that leads them from success to misfortune after Worm is caught cheating and the man who caught him (John Malkovich) wants his money back.Whereas Ben Affleck continues to go downhill after \"Good Will Hunting,\" Matt Damon has striven uphill, taking on daring productions such as \"The Talented Mr. Ripley,\" \"The Bourne Identity\" series, and of course \"Rounders,\" which features one of his best performances. Damon has become typecast as some sort of bad actor in the league of Affleck, but he's much better than his pal, and films like this prove it.Norton is once again superb as one of his characters you love to hate. He's got the character of Worm down pat, and it really elevates the acting (along with Damon) to a level of greatness.The film is directed and written very well, offering realistic dialog and gritty environments. However the flaws of the movie are its long running time (two hours exactly), which could have been shortened, and probably the fact that its card playing is sometimes a bit alienating to the audience.That said, this is still a very underrated movie featuring outstanding performances and a unique spin on gambling flicks. Worth watching at least once in a lifetime.",

It managed to hang in there throughout, though the ending was too formulaic. In addition, the voice-over at the very end reminded me of the final scene in Saving Private Ryan. It almost ruins a fantastic film.The only other objection I can come up with is that the you must know, you must be type philosophy being handed out was just a tad hokey. I must pleasantly admit though, since I don't get to admit this very often, that The Matrix is worth seeing despite these things.The visuals are extremely impressive, particularly the \"white room,\" the baby harvester, the training scene with the \"red woman,\" the Reeves interrogation scene... I have to agree with some of the previous comments that the plot idea won't seem overly original to a fan of Philip K Dick, but then what is original after you've read him? The Matrix has more original things to say than two months worth of standard Hollywood fare. I have a great deal of respect for a film which will have someone say \"they're turning humans into this\" and hold up a battery. A plot which looks at man as machine will get a thumbs up from me just for trying.I feel some hope for the future of movie-making in America to be able to recommend this film.",

He wants to be rich, he wants approval and he is may be just an opportunist. Creepy because he latches on like a leech, he can't take rejection and though he doesn't plan but once he assumes the identity of someone else he can go to any extent to keep that. Actually one can identify with the character so much that it's almost scary to look inside your dark corners.Matt Damon played this three-dimensional character so well that I almost became a huge fan of his. Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf, whose identity Tom Ripley steals was very good as well. The movie is shot in Italy, moves at a leisurely speed and is very atmospheric.

    "review": "HERO (Ma Yong Zhen)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: MonoCorey Yuen's period adventure HERO marked an impressive return to the action movie fold by Shaw Brothers, following a long period in which the studio had concentrated almost exclusively on TV production. A remake of the Chang Cheh classic BOXER FROM SHANTUNG (1972), HERO follows the adventures of a courageous country boy (Takeshi Kaneshiro) who flees rural poverty and relocates to Shanghai circa 1911, where his impressive fighting skills bring him to the attention of a benevolent gangster (Yuen Biao) who agrees to mentor him. Thus emboldened, Kaneshiro rises through the ranks of the criminal underworld, until he's challenged by a powerful rival (Yuen Tak) who plots against him. Tragedy ensues.The concept is old-fashioned, but director Yuen energizes proceedings with New Wave fervor, employing thousands of extras in a bid to recreate the majesty of old Shanghai, whilst filming the combat sequences in a defiantly modern manner, pitting hordes of axe-wielding assailants against lone protagonists who are forced to use acrobatic manoeuvres and everyday objects to fend off a potentially horrific death. Yuen's script (co-written with Kay On) is eventful and melodramatic, and the sweeping visuals (by cinematographer Tom Lau) are further highlighted by a sumptuous music score, co-written by William Hu, Raymond Wong and Lincoln Lo. But while the film delivers on action and spectacle, it fails to establish the characters as anything more than stock figures, which essentially limits the narrative's dramatic impact. For all that, however, the performances are uniformly excellent, and HERO's all-star cast is divided squarely into the beautiful (Kaneshiro, Valerie Chow, Jessica Hester), the bold (Yuen Biao at his most virtuous), and the beastly (Yuen Tak as the villain, lacking only a top hat, cloak and twirly moustache).NB. Shot in mainland China, the film was consequently subject to strict Chinese censorship laws which curtailed some of the gorier violence (a Shaw Brothers trademark). These scenes weren't restored for the HK theatrical/video release, though a more complete version turned up later on DVD in the UK.(Cantonese dialogue)",

I kept waiting for a reason to change the opinion that the first act puts to you regarding him but it never came, there's never a point I cared for him and I assume I was supposed to... at least to some degree? Also, his issue is thrown at you in one scene and isn't really mentioned again until the end. I get the character, just not his arc.Ethan Hawke is very good, too, in this, even if I kept hearing Tom Cruise when he spoke... You also have a load of now familiar faces involved, including Eva Mendes, Raymond Cruz, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Terry Crews. Quite an interesting cast list, that.Loved all of this, except the (still good) plot execution. Maybe that's just me though. From what I've seen, Washington's best performance so far.

    "review": "It's hard not to like \"Big Daddy\", though diehard fans of Adam Sandler may well cringe at this further step in the sentimentalization of the comic actor.  For although this film has raised the hackles of a number of overly sensitive worrywarts for its seeming endorsement of permissive parenting, the film is, in reality, far more soft-hearted than hard-edged.  Actually, this seems to be, probably, the wisest direction for Sandler to go in at the moment because, as an actor, he conveys an aura of genuine likability that fits well with his Average Joe persona.  \"Big Daddy\" might have been a better film if it had not given in so easily to sentimentality and predictable emotional uplift, but Sandler's deadpan portrayal of an immature adult forced to grow up into responsibility-laden fatherhood makes the film relatively enjoyable.Sandler portrays a 30-something loser living in South Manhattan, who has been milking a minor foot injury to the tune of a $200,000 court settlement and whose life, consequently, consists of miniscule employment, a general lack of direction, and a girlfriend who's ready to move on to an older man with a \"5-year plan\".  When a little boy suddenly shows up on his doorstep (the hitherto unknown son of a friend of his), Sandler decides to temporarily take him under his wing in the hopes of winning his girlfriend back.  Thus, a man with almost no resources of adult maturity attempts to instill skewed life lessons into a willing, highly impressionable young mind.  This leads to Sandler's teaching the boy to indulge in predictable, but surprisingly timid, antisocial behavior such as urinating on public buildings, staying up late, tripping unsuspecting rollerbladers etc.  The film is not always at its peak of creative freshness at such times, but Sandler's lowkey cynicism provides some humor.As Sandler grows to care for his tot and the inevitable forces array themselves against him to take the child away, the film veers off in the direction of sappiness and maudlin tearjerking.  One may be moved at times, but one also craves the satirical sharpness and bite that a more courageous screenplay might have provided.The movie does display an enlightened view of gays (though Hollywood has yet to get past the point where gay characters can do more than merely twinkle at each other), but it loses points for its rather nasty tone towards old people.  Still, any film designed to send Dr. Laura into spasms of psychoanalytical outrage should be respected and honored.Overall, \"Big Daddy\" is a movie that, if it had taken more audacious pathways, might have been a firstrate comedy.  As it is, it provides numerous chuckles and a cuddly warm feeling - and that, given the state of much of big screen comedy these days, is about all we dare allow ourselves to expect.",

All this action before the James Bond title song and it's carried out not just for show, but as it's all part of the story's later developments.Michael Apted directs the 19th Bond instalment in which Brosnan gives his finest performance as 007, he appears, confident, intellectual, more dangerous and authentic as the spy. In this he is injured and carries his ailment throughout the film, making him more vulnerable and real in life threaten situations, leaving the entertaining but bland Tomorrow Never Dies behind. For the most part this instalment is more grounded and played serious with fewer gags than in previous Bonds, certainly less than Moore's outings. A lot of this is due to Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Bruce Feirstein screenplay which lends itself as a mystery, whodunit thriller theme and the villains, have more shades of grey as well as the heroes.Despite, Denise Richards beauty with brains role as Dr. Christmas Jones, she still appears as the typical Bond girl by the end. Robert Carlyle character Renard is given depth and ulterior motives as the villain but he still is clich\u00e9 Bond Villain with scars. This aside, Sophie Marceau is excellent as femme fatale oil baron heiress Elektra King and M's (Judie Dench) late friends daughter. Dench is given more to do and shines on screen, and regulars Desmond Llewelyn (Q), Samantha Bond (Miss Moneypenny) and Colin Salmon reprise their roles. Robbie Coltrane makes a welcomed return as Zukovsky to briefly assist Bond, and Goldie makes an appearance as a henchman. Comedy legend John Cleese plays Q's side kick R. The music score and Barry's trademark theme comes in just at the right moments to heighten the action on screen. And as a bonus the title songs music is interlaced throughout the movie.The World Is Not Enough is only marred by some poor cringe-worthy quips that are synonyms with the franchise. It's a shame that all the hard work of writers, Bronson's and Apted's subtly was discarded in Die Another Day (2002), where it was CGI heavy and returned to a Moore- like, lighter spectacle adventure.This Bond is in the tradition of the earlier Connery outings, the vein of Dalton's steely incarnation, and a credit must goto Pierce Brosnan as this influenced the style of the later Casino Royale rework.Ultimately, The World Is Not Enough due to it's great plot is one of the better Bonds that can be enjoyed by fans and the causal viewer.",

    "review": "The first Austin Powers movie was a shot-in-the-dark comedy Michael Myers pretty much made for himself and a few friends, little imagining the fuss it would spawn. This time, Myers and his alter egos set out to build a middle-brow entertainment franchise. At least they got the money part right.After spending the first movie adjusting to life in the 1990s, superspy Austin Powers (Myers) is pulled back into his native 1960s to save his mojo from the evil Dr. Evil (Myers), who has stolen it with the help of traitorous Scot Fat Bastard (Myers). Will Austin save his mojo, and not incidentally, the world?While not as satisfying or clever as the first Powers film, \"Spy Who Shagged Me\" does make you laugh, especially the first time you see it. Fat Bastard is a terrific new addition to the Powers tribe, a nasty self-worshipping slob who wears a metric ton and has an appetite that is boundless, morally as well as physically.\"Listen up, Sonny Jim, I ate a baby!\" FB declares. \"Baby: The other, other white meat!\"Also great is Verne Troyer as Dr. Evil's stunted replicant, Mini-Me. Troyer's tiny stature makes for a good initial guilty laugh, but Troyer throws himself into the role with the same kind of abandon and hidden talent Myers employed in the first film. Mini-Me's confrontations with Dr. Evil's biological son Scott (Seth Green) is an entertaining subplot throughout.Myers himself is a bit of a mix. As Fat Bastard, he is about as funny as he's ever been on screen. As Austin and Dr. Evil, he's a little too much too often. Dr. Evil seems to be after laughs from the MTV Music Awards crowd, mocking rap videos and repeating old gags like telling Scott to be quiet (this time with the catch phrase \"Zip it\" rather than \"Shh...\") Austin is a grab bag of catch phrases, interspersed with the occasional double entendre, like when his latest lady, Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), notices he activates his apartment lights by clapping his hands.\"When did you get the clapper?\" she asks.\"November, 1964, Dutch East Indies, shore leave,\" he replies.Graham is beautiful to look at but a bit of a damp noodle otherwise, which goes for much of \"The Spy Who Shagged Me.\" Sure, you have the clever set design, costumes, and music that the original \"Austin Powers\" had in spades, but the heart of the enterprise is missing here. Austin throws off one after another of his merchandise-ready puns, and it's hard not to enjoy it in fitful bursts. But it doesn't linger like the first film.",

I knew I could count on Paul Newman to deliver a top notch performance as he has done in the past.Newman leads a cast, which includes Dermot Mulroney and Linda Fiorentino. These three are on a mission to pull off a bank job. It is not as simple as we think; Newman, a master bank thief, has been remanded to a hospital after suffering a stroke (or is it). This is where he meets a nurse who is sees through his charade and wants in on the action. The stakes have risen when the nurse's husband gets wrangled into the bank job.\"Where The Money Is\" plays to everybody's funny bone because Newman gives one of his most engaging performances. The one aspect of the film I enjoyed the most was Newman's captivating presence on screen with each scene he was in. He pulled the audience in with his charm and made them a part of a film.Though the plot has been done before in other movies, the way it was performed left me breathless because it is so unique. I have to give credit to Fiorentino and Mulroney because they play off Newman very well.\"Where The Money Is\" is captivating as it is funny. When you add Paul Newman's humor and comedy with great support from Linda Fiorentino and Dermot Mulroney you have a rousing success in \"Where The Money Is.\"",

    "plot": "Jodie Foster landed the role of Libby after Meg Ryan and Brooke Shields both declined, but was replaced by Ashley Judd when Foster became pregnant.",
    "review": "If \"Double Jeopardy\" succeeds at all as entertainment, it is thanks to two basic elements:  the luminous, feisty performance by Ashley Judd and the fact that the story taps into a pair of sure-fire emotional grabbers - the attempt by a falsely convicted person to prove his or her innocence and the wrenching spectacle of a mother being unduly separated from her child.This trite revenge melodrama is, otherwise, a fairly mediocre piece of pop culture trash, short on solid character development and long on credibility-defying illogic.  Judd plays the wife of a multimillionaire businessman who is framed for the murder of her husband (an ersatz murder, by the way, whose logistics are never explained either to Judd or to the audience), spends six years behind bars and then, when released, goes in search of not only the husband she now knows is alive and well but the son whom she has not seen in all that time.  Tommy Lee Jones co-stars as her parole officer who, at first, attempts to inhibit her search then, becoming convinced of her truthfulness, joins her in her effort to exact proper revenge.The film sets up its framework on a very shaky premise.  We are expected to believe, idiotically, that Judd is free to murder her husband for real this time with full impunity, covered by the double jeopardy legal argument that one cannot be tried twice for the same crime.  Any film that believes its audience is that gullible is unlikely to win over too many converts. Similarly, are we really to swallow the fact that a man as professional as Jones' parole officer appears to be would leave the keys in the ignition while his prisoner sits in the car handcuffed to the door handle while he goes looking for a cup of coffee?  And would a man who has managed to eliminate two wives so successfully and establish himself as a pillar of the community under several different aliases allow himself to be fooled so easily into confessing his crime into a concealed tape recorder?  Such lapses in logic permeate this entire film. The movie does deserve credit for keeping the Judd/Jones relationship a strictly platonic one, thereby avoiding the romantic cliches that could truly overwhelm the proceedings.  And Jones nicely underplays a role that, in other directorial hands, might have lent itself to hyperbole and bombast.All told, however, I'm afraid that one's enjoyment of \"Double Jeopardy\" is predicated mostly on how willing one is to suspend critical judgment and go with the facts as they are presented.  Unfortunately, the film is not tightly edited or suspenseful  enough to allow the audience to ride over all these crests of incredibility.  The result is a watchable, but neither compelling nor memorable, piece of pulp fiction tripe.",

    "review": "What's new, I don't think anyone doubts Raj Kapoor's phenomenal talent in terms of filmmaking. Ram Teri Ganga Maili is overwhelming in its beauty, in how well it captures the extraordinary picturesque views of the Himalayas, the stormy rivers of the waterfalls, and what not. The cinematography is perfect, and the setting is very impressive, creating a rather extravagant film. Raj Kapoor keeps his obsession with the female body and with showing nudity to a most conservative censor board, and does it as aesthetically as he always did, with some highly suggestive transparent clothing, shots of full breastfeeding.In terms of writing the film has a stronger first half - great romantic portions and all you'd expect, but the execution, the dialogue and the acting by the smaller actors is very bad. It is further ruined by embarrassingly absurd action scenes, which make one lament that someone of the stature of Raj Kapoor succumbed to the cheap dishum dishum of the times. Then also the caricature villains take the credibility of the story down. It is exactly the same kind of problems that Kapoor's previous venture, Prem Rog, faced. A very pretty film to look at but very melodramatic and stereotypical in its portrayal of the suffering heroine.And coming to the heroine and the film's main protagonist - Mandakini is exactly a reflection of the film itself - she is stunning, and her beauty is captured with great mastery, but performance-wise she falters and wavers between refreshing and charming and then very weak and struggling with too much drama. But who cares, when you have such an unusual beauty, much can be forgiven. The casting of Kapoor's youngest son Rajiv as the male lead is exactly like the casting of Rishi Kapoor in Bobby a decade before, and although he is okay and does okay within the context of the film, it's nothing special.The film's other highlights include some nice supporting turns, especially by the great Saeed Jaffrey who gets great lines and a nice role. Kulbhushan Kharbanda and Sushma Seth are also very good. But the winner of the film after all is another person, a woman whose name is Lata Mangeshkar. This legendary singer's phenomenal voice does wonders to the film and gives it much of the charm that the script doesn't. My favourite number is \"Sun Sahiba Sun\" which is a pleasure to listen to. I wish the film matched the beauty of the music and the photography. Ram Teri Ganga Maili is Raj Kaoor's final but far from his finest.",

    "review": "Sohni Mahiwal review :Sunny Deol's debut 'Betaab' was a smash hit of 1983. Naturally, there were high expectations from his next release and Sohni Mahiwal did not disappoint the audience. Produced by FC Mehra's Eagle Films, this was their second Indo- Soviet co-production after the successful Alibaba aur 40 Chor (1980).Re-telling the classic love saga of Sohni Mahiwal, Sunny Deol and Poonam Dhillon played the eternal couple whom even death couldn't keep apart. Both the actors were not the first choice and Kumar Gaurav was approached for the lead but dad Rajendra Kumar asked for a high price which lead the producers to Dharmendra who advised beta Sunny to sign the movie. Dimple Kapadia was the original choice for Sohni but she was committed to Ramesh Sippy's Saagar (1985) and declined the role. Poonam Dhillon then came on board.The character of Zara daku was specially written for Zeenat Aman whom the Russians loved in Abdullah (1980) and Alibaba aur 40 Chor. She even got her own backstory involving Mazhar Khan in a cameo. Zeenat and Mazhar fell in love during the filming and later got married.Sunny and Poonam made a sweet pair and the film was finely executed with top production values and melodious music. Particularly, Anu Malik became famous with this film and signed many prestigious projects after this. The exotic locales of Ural mountain ranges of the former Soviet Union were wonderfully captured on screen.Sohni Mahiwal became a huge success at the box office. By the time, it released in Russia and became a blockbuster there, it had already celebrated silver jubilee hit in India. But Sunny Deol had also added two flops to his name by then - Sunny and Manzil Manzil.Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

    "review": "\"Swami\" is based on a story written by the Bengali novelist, Sharat Chandra Chattopadhaya, whose many works have been made into movies, like Devdas, Parineeta, Apne Paraye, all dealing with the social issues. Very few film makers pick the rich literary work to the big screen and do justice to them. \"Swami\" is a nice effort in the league and becomes admirable for the tie it makes with the eastern values and culture.\"Swami\" delves into the story of a woman who first dejects her family and husband and slowly understands the values of family and a marriage. The story is far behind today's life, where the society use to be male dominated with the males only the bread earners of the family and the women are mere the house wives though they might be educated. Due to the story, settings, and an average technical treatment the film has a bit faded look; and its slow pace makes it hard to keep up at instances. The music and photography aren't notable. However, except for few roles, there is a much of spontaneity in the characters, especially that shown in Girish Karnad's family, where the disputes are over small things of life like the daily chores of the kitchen. The simplicity of the film is able to touch you. Girish Karnad and Shabana Azmi both look spontaneous in their roles. Vikram looks weak. It's the realization of the eastern values and culture with a simplicity in the story that makes the film adorable. Though the story doesn't reflect today's realities where the husband and wife both make a livelihood, it still offers the roots of our society.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",

Where the previous one suffered from chronically bad casting for the Flintstones and the Rubbles (except for Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma), this benefits from Stephen Baldwin and Jane \"Best reason to watch 'Ally McBeal' not called Lucy Liu\" Krakowski making a far less annoying Barney and Betty than Rick Moranis and Rosie O'Donnell (the latter the only major cast member to return here, in voice mode only). The movie also has a few nice little touches like pictures of the cartoon Fred and Barney handed out to people, and the specially modified Universal logo with the Earth only showing one continent behind the word \"Univershell\" (\"Did anyone else see those giant letters out there?\").Alan Cumming as the Great Gazoo (and a Mick Jagger-type rock star) is also one of the movie's pros... and indicative of its cons. Writers Deborah Kaplan & Harry Elfont (\"Can't Hardly Wait,\" \"Josie and the Pussycats\") and the late Jim Cash & Jack Epps, Jr (\"Top Gun,\" \"Anaconda\") go for too many cheap gags, have a wilful disregard for the show's mythology - Gazoo didn't arrive until Fred and Barney were both married with children, for starters (and as another poster rightly says, he crashlanded as opposed to being sent) - and don't really have much of a plot going for them. The movie's all as silly as that episode where the boys befriended \"Ann-Margrock\" without knowing who she was. Speaking of which, Ann-Margret (who guested on the TV show) returns to Bedrock to sing \"Viva Rock Vegas\" in a montage and over the credits, but her take isn't a patch on the BC-52's version of the theme song in the first one, and indeed the overall feeling of going down a level is everywhere - not just in the plot of Wilma's mum wanting her daughter (a miscast Kristen Johnston) to marry an uppercrust type (Thomas Gibson from \"Dharma & Greg\"), but from the cast to the visual effects (Rhythm & Hues aren't quite up to Industrial Light & Magic's level) to the music (song-wise, that is; David Newman at least tries), the movie fits in all too well alongside the other losers directed by Brian Levant, he of \"Problem Child\" and \"Jingle All The Way\" infamy. And I still think James Belushi, not John Goodman or Mark Addy, IS Fred Flintstone.At least the first one had Halle Berry and some puns in the credits (though this does have Jane Krakowski - hubba hubba).

    "review": "\"Behind Enemy Lines\" is a film with a bit of controversy. The story clearly was based on the experiences of US Air Force pilot Scott O'Grady...but they took great liberties with the facts and O'Grady felt he was maligned by the movie because the lead (Owen Wilson) had a lousy attitude at the beginning of the film and was insubordinate...unlike the real life O'Grady. The film also changes a lot of the facts--making the plane a two-seat Navy plane (an F-18 Super Eagle) flown from an aircraft carrier instead of the single seat F-16 O'Grady flew from an air base. Regardless, the film still is quite exciting and worth seeing.The story begins on a US aircraft carrier. Lt. Burnett (Wilson) is annoyed flying during the 1995 cease fire over what was Yugoslavia, as they are simply flying reconnaissance missions...and avoiding combat with the Bosnians. After submitting his request for discharge from the Navy, the Admiral (Gene Hackman) chews Burnett out and assigns him extra duty...in this case, a recon mission on Christmas.Unfortunately, the two-seat plane is shot down by Serbs...a violation of the cease fire. After both the pilot and navigator eject, the Serbs execute the pilot...and the navigator, Burnett, manages to escape and the rest of the film concerns the Serbs trying to kill Burnett because of the information he's gained from the mission about troop movements and genocide. To avoid death, Burnett runs many miles over hostile territory to safety.As I watched the film, it became clear that the film was intended thrill audiences at the expense of common sense....especially at the end of the picture. Seeing the Admiral flying a helicopter on the rescue mission seemed pretty dopey and the US Navy would never risk a command officer on such a mission. There also were some stunts at the end which were pretty dim as well. Exciting? Yes....but at the expense of realism. In reality, helicopters AND Marine fighter planes were involved in the mission (the film onlys showed helicopters, which seemed silly flying into such hostile territory when they DID have an aircraft carrier filled with planes!).Oh, and while it's not terribly important, the film takes place over Christmas and O'Grady's plane was actually shot down around June.Overall, a fun film to watch but do NOT take it to be a history lesson.",

Once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War-era \"Cold Mountain,\" starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger is such a film.Then again, calling Cold Mountain\" a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts \"Glory\" director Edward Zwick shame. However, \"Cold Mountain\" is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.\"Cold Mountain\" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile, back at the farm, Ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails Ruby Thewes, played by Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, who helps Ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada.Within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's deadbeat father, Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern \"lawman,\" and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by \"the war of Northern aggression,\" mostly for the worse. The dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.Make no mistake, \"Cold Mountain\" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.",

    "review": "I came into contact with Mecha anime way after the first Gundam movie came out, but I think it was some sort of newer Gundam or Evangelion thing. At the time I thought it was stupid and it turned me off Mecha forever. Yet, with unlimited time to \"work from home\", I now had the opportunity to watch the original Gundam animes on Netflix. And, for 1981, I think Gundam is brilliant!Now, the animation is decent but dated, the acting and individual scenes are very Japanese and annoyingly communal. You get the classic woman who can't stop herself to care about children and some man, whether they like it or not, and who knows what's decent and good. You get the glorious nakamas who would do anything for each other except listen when they are told to run or save themselves or something like that. Apparently standing around and shouting someone's name when they are in danger is a genius military strategy. You get the senior people getting to decide how to bring someone down or humiliate them a bit in order for them to not get too cocky. So it might be difficult to get into the mood, especially if you are some American gen Z person who still hasn't acknowledged that the rest of the world exists. Ironically, if you are into fight movies, you might not like it either, because it shows how ugly and petty war is.However, with all that said, the show has a complex political and historical universe to play on. The characters, good and bad, are complex and relatable. The little details of space combat and giant robot mechanics are pretty thought out, to the point that you start to believe that it makes some sense to have huge metallic humanoids fighting it out. What I liked most was that it showed war as it really is: groups within groups within groups of people, all scheming and positioning themselves towards some goal that only they know (or care) about, senseless death, backstabbing, uniformed politicians and generals and nobles that feel other people are their toys to play with. For people who witnessed a world war from the losing side, war is not fun.So yeah, it is a show about giant robots fighting each other, but also a very adult antiwar show. I can't quite recommend it, because some people might not quite connect, but I think that if you get into it, you will love it.",

    "review": "The war between the Principality of Zeon and the Earth Federation continues as the crew of the White Base and newtype Gundam pilot Amuro Ray return to space for a final confrontation with Zeon as the infighting among the Zabi family continues and Char Aznable intends to finish off Amuro and the Gundam once and for all.The final film in the compilation film trilogy of Mobile Suit Gundam's first series, Mobile Suit Gundam III: Encounters in Space is noted for containing the most new footage of the three films added by Yoshiyuki Tomino. The movie is the best of the of three Mobile Suit Gundam compilation films because it has the most \"complete feeling\" to it with adequately established stakes and a sense of finality that leaves it a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy.Pretty much every point established is paid off here from Amuro's conflict with Char, to Sayla Mass and her relationship with Char as her long lost brother, and Char's conflict with the Zabi family. All the primary and secondary characters feel like they've come full circle at this point with harrowing action sequences and striking moments of emotional resonance that kept me engaged throughout the 2 and \u00bd hour runtime. A solid inclusion to this movie is definitely in regards to the Zabi family who's backstabbing and conniving makes them really strong characters who feel like they could've been the basis of a series unto themselves, but we're just given tidbits as to what goes on with them unfortunately. Amuro and Char's conflict is also given more weight with the inclusion of another newtype named Lalah who like the Zabi family feels like she could've been further developed and established.Encounters in Space does a mostly successful job of closing the book on the theatrical retelling of the original Mobile Suit Gundam series. There's a sense of desperation in the stakes as well as a sense of finality that makes this entry the most fully realized film of the trilogy and hits all the key points of Gundam and its foundations. While it does rely on you seeing the first two movies, it's a mostly successful payoff to two films worth of build-up.",

Run by a well spoken Donald Sutherland and Anne Archer, it's a low key 'fight fire with fire' situation, until it all goes tits up and Snipes is framed for the murder of some bigwig Chinese dirtbag. Forced to contend with Triads, government factions and his own former partner gone rogue (Michael Biehn steals every scene, as usual), it's a nice set up for a serviceable, above average action yarn. That Oriental influence always seems to make these thrillers seem cooler (ever seen Black Rain or Rising Sun?) which helps as well. Snipes and Biehn are livewires though and have a fantastic silenced pistol duel late in the third act, which is one slick showcase of a sequence. Not a whole lot to this one, but as an entertaining garden variety actioner, it holds up just fine.",

    "review": "Robert Zemeckis's \"What Lies Beneath,\" released in 2000, is a compelling blend of supernatural horror and suspenseful thriller. Anchored by stellar performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford, the film delivers an atmospheric, spine-chilling experience despite a few plot contrivances.\"What Lies Beneath\" centers on Claire Spencer (Michelle Pfeiffer), who starts experiencing strange occurrences in her Vermont home after her daughter leaves for college. Her husband, Norman (Harrison Ford), dismisses her fears as empty nest syndrome. But as the ghostly encounters escalate, Claire is pulled into a terrifying mystery that reveals shocking secrets about her life and marriage.Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is the beating heart of the movie. As Claire, she expertly conveys a wide spectrum of emotions - from initial unease to sheer terror, and finally, desperate resolve. Pfeiffer's nuanced portrayal of a woman grappling with inexplicable supernatural events while also questioning her sanity keeps the viewers rooted in the narrative. Harrison Ford, diverging from his typical heroic roles, delivers a surprisingly subdued yet effective performance as the aloof and somewhat dismissive husband.The film's strengths lie in its masterful build-up of suspense. Zemeckis, known for his work on films like \"Back to the Future\" and \"Forrest Gump,\" shows a flair for creating an atmosphere of mounting dread. The use of slow, tension-filled sequences, chilling music score, and artful cinematography makes the most of the spooky New England setting, resulting in numerous effective jump scares.However, \"What Lies Beneath\" does have its weaknesses. The plot relies heavily on some genre tropes and contrivances, with a few twists that may feel predictable for avid thriller or horror viewers. The pacing is uneven at times, with the film taking a while to get going, and some plot points feel somewhat rushed or underdeveloped.The supernatural elements and the focus on character-driven tension give \"What Lies Beneath\" a Hitchcockian feel. However, the narrative doesn't always maintain this subtlety, occasionally veering into more conventional horror territory, especially towards the end.In conclusion, \"What Lies Beneath\" is an engaging supernatural thriller that benefits from strong performances and a creepy, suspense-filled atmosphere. Despite some plot and pacing issues, it offers a gripping and occasionally terrifying viewing experience that will appeal to fans of the genre.",

Yes, the director and the two big name stars are the same as the film's 1990 counterpart, but even though the two films have striking and almost offensive similarities, Runaway Bride has a good enough story that I refuse to believe that it relied on the success of its predecessor. Julia Roberts is Maggie Carpenter, a hardware store owner (a laughable profession surpassed only by Denise Richards as a nuclear weapons specialist in The World Is Not Enough. Yeah RIGHT!), and Richard Gere is a newspaper columnist (Ike Graham) who has been fired for printing a supposedly false column about a woman who consistently runs out on her marriages. When he travels to the tiny town where she lives to learn more about her life and possibly get his job back, he finds that there is more to her than just a newspaper column. By the end of the film, there is such a huge media hype about Maggie's wedding that it's a wonder that Ike wasn't honored for his 'false' column about her. Joan Cusack has never looked and acted better than she did in this movie, delivering a wonderful nasally performance that was strangely heartwarming. Runaway Bride had all kinds of wonderful scenes. I particularly liked the wedding rehearsal scene. The look on Christopher Meloni's face was priceless! There were so many good things about this film that I am able to overlook the superficial look of unoriginality. If you just look past the director and the two big names, the story itself is not at all like any other film. There will, of course, be the inevitable cynical comparisons to Pretty Woman, and these complaints are understandable, but people who condemn Runaway Bride as a rip-off of Pretty Woman or some sort of re-make are simply not looking at the film, but only at the names on the bill. This is a very good romantic comedy, and it should not be missed simply because of a superficial comparison to Pretty Woman.",

    "review": "The Sum of All Fears is directed by Phil Alden Robinson and adapted to screenplay by Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne from the novel of the same name written by Tom Clancy. It stars Ben Affleck, Morgan Freeman, James Cromwell, Ciaran Hinds, Liev Schreiber, Bridget Moynahan and Michael Byrne. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by John Lindley.Film is the fourth film to feature the character Jack Ryan (Affleck). It is set in present day 2002 but with Ryan younger than in the other films and at the start of his career in the CIA. Plot is Cold War themed and finds America in a sweat when it is found that renegade terrorists have a nuclear weapon in their possession; just as a new supposed radical president takes up office in Russia.Our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet, we all breathe the same air, we all cherish our children's futures, and we are all mortal.2002 saw two great thrillers released that starred Ben Affleck, one was Changing Lanes, the other was this Jack Ryan based effort that attempted to reboot the series. Coming a year after the September 11 attacks and featuring a plot involving terrorists using a bomb that America supplied the Israelis in the 70s during the Yom Kippur War, it was material too close to the bone for some critics. Yet the film did well at the box office in the States and including Worldwide takings it garnered well over $100 million in profit. Impressive figures considering it's not an action blockbuster, it relies on brain over brawn and leading man Affleck was on the back of Pearl Harbor and bearing the brunt of critical scorn.Each day we lose a little bit more of our separate, sovereign ability to determine our own futures... and each day the world comes a little bit closer to that terrible moment when the beating of a butterfly's wings unleashes a hurricane God himself cannot stop.Comforted by the superb cast around him, which also includes the likes of Colm Feore, Phillip Baker Hall and Alan Bates in support slots, Affleck proves perfect for the material to hand. Without doubt he's no Harrison Ford, in the same way Moynahan is no Anne Archer, tough boots to fill in the roles of Jack and Cathy Ryan respectively, but in a re-jig of Ryan the character, we now have the arrogance of youth dressed up in slacks and t-shirt, a smart brained youngster beginning his CIA career at a perilous time, a time that thankfully is devoid of jingoistic flag waving, but of adult political sensibilities. Affleck's Ryan as a character is as refreshing as the writers' responsible attitude is.You dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. You dropped the bomb on Nagasaki. Do not lecture me on Chechnya!With shades of the Cuban Missile Crisis and a Fail-Safe like finale, The Sum of All Fears rounds out as a nail biter of a thriller. Dig deeper and some implausibilities surface, but we are asked to tune into the paranoia and get in deep with the characters trying to avert global catastrophe, to decry the film's cerebral thriller qualities is churlish. The Jack Ryan parts of the film involving Cathy the girlfriend are the least interesting, but here's the thing, young Jack Ryan is just one of the components making up a far bigger whole. The film isn't solely a Jack Ryan movie. The source novel was a door stopper, so inevitably much as been excised from it, and inevitably fans of the book have been vocal in their displeasure; though we would have needed another hour of film to even get close to Clancy's big block of fiction. So in place is a picture that is uncomplicated in structure and story telling and comes in at under two hours running time. It's credit to director Robinson that The Sum of All Fears engrosses from start to finish.It was hoped that the reboot would herald the start of a run of more Jack Ryan based movies, but in spite of the great box office, this didn't materialise. But that is in no way any marker to the quality of the film, or its standing in the Jack Ryan series. Judge it on its own merits and ideas and the rewards are many, especially on a second viewing. At the time of writing Jack Ryan will return to the big screen in December 2013, titled simply as Jack Ryan, with another young actor, Chris Pine in the role of Ryan. Undoubtedly that will be high on action, such is the way of drawing in the young dollars at the multiplexes these days. But if it has half the tension and brains of Robinson's picture then we will be blessed. If not? Then there's an even bigger reason to treasure Jack Ryan's 2002 version. 7.5/10",

The cinematography is skillful and stylish, and the music is nicely done and adds to the suspense. The pace in general is brisk, apart from it being forced on occasions when it tried to fit in too many plot twists, and the story springs from an interesting concept. The script has some very good moments, and the direction is very good. The performances apart from Monica Potter are strong, with Morgan Freeman great as always and Michael Wincott solid as the kidnapper. Mika Boorem shows promise as a blossoming young actress, and Penelope Ann Miller does a very nice job as her mother.

    "review": "Duplicate is a sort of spin-off on the 1978 classic Don, starring Amitabh Bachchan, which would later be remade officially by Farhan Akhtar in two hit films. Duplicate, however, is not very good, although it is slightly enjoyable. Shah Rukh Khan plays two roles, Bablu and Manu, the good and the bad, and he really hams it up in both roles. That being said, he is quite fun and through the role of Bablu and his story we get to see some lovable qualities. He is an innocent cook, very endearing, and has a wonderful relationship with his mother (Farida Jalal). The same cannot be said about the forced villain of Manu, and Bablu remains the main element that makes it partly work, which is only enhanced with the entrance of the lovely and kind Sonia Kapoor (Juhi Chawla). Their interaction is quite heartwarming and entertaining. Juhi Chawla is really wonderful in this film, and she is able to balance Khan's immature Bablu, which could otherwise get on the nerves. Everything else in this film, sadly, is a mess, and it only becomes messier as the story goes on. At many points it is really hard to believe this film was directed by Mahesh Bhatt. It would be ineffective even for David Dhawan, and towards the end it becomes really mindless, and not very entertaining. Duplicate could be watched for those fond of Shah Rukh Khan, even those willing to forgive his wild, childish overacting which is more than evident in this film. His screen presence, however, remains undiminished, and so is his ability to make fun of himself and to shed all his inhibitions, and that's why fans could give it a half chance.",

To get rid of Stuart, Snowball reaches out to some local alley cats to set up a whack on Stuart.If my plot synopsis has talked up the mafia connotations of the cats, it is because that is the part of the film that I find the funniest part of the film because it is lacking in the syrup that kind of takes away from the rest of the film.  The main story is quite sweet but also has a good sense of humour that will appeal to adults as much as children.  It's not perfect for, like I said it does get a bit overly sentimental at times although it just about manages to stay sweetly sentimental and not fall into being sickly sentimental.The animation is superb and only occasionally does Stuart look out of place in the frame.  For the most part it all flows well together and was deserving of the Oscar nomination.  Just as deserving is the animal training - anyone with cats will know how hard it is to get the little b*stards to do anything you want, so to have them do so much work is very impressive (although I understand it is all about food).The cast are all pretty good.  Davis and Laurie play it straight and are lumbered with carrying the emotional side of the film and don't have much comedy (a shame considering Laurie's talents).  Michael J. Fox does the best work - he makes his Stuart very sweet and likeable; a true prince amongst mice!  Lipnicki does OK but is basically just the `cute kid' that is legally required in all American family movies.  The funny stuff comes from Lane, Zahn, Kirby, Tilly and, best of all, Palminteri, who's mafia cat is hilarious and sends up his own characters by doing so.Overall this is an enjoyable family film.  It may not be hilarious for adults in the way Toy Story and it's like are but it is not dull.  It has characters for adults and plenty for children and it's all a bit of fun with a slightly overly sweet centre to it.",

    "review": "Guillermo Del Toro's \"Hellboy\" is really the sort of comic book adaptation that should be commonplace- a film that feels every bit like a comic book in its energy, style, and visual feel, but is entirely worthy on a cinematic level as well.Sadly, \"Hellboy\" doesn't really have much of a plot, at least for half of its running time. Its first hour is Hellboy fighting squids and the mandatory character introductions, and its second hour feels pretty rushed as a result, having to introduce and resolve the bulk of the film's story. Thankfully, however, \"Hellboy\" avoids the comic book-to-film clich\u00e9 of basing the first film of any given franchise on the 'superhero origin story' (not that Hellboy is much of a superhero, he's really just a smartass with a gun, except he's from hell), instead keeping all that to a short and dazzling pre-credits sequence. Other than the somewhat rushed and oddly-placed plot aspects, Del Toro's screenplay is fairly impressive, providing plenty of nods towards the comics and a good amount of wit and humor, also echoing the nature of Mike Mignola's work.The most impressive aspects of \"Hellboy\" are Del Toro's direction and Guillermo Navarro's photography. Del Toro was always a superb director in terms of visuals, although I've had issues with several of his scripts. His most accomplished film to date in this regard would probably be the superb \"The Devil's Backbone\", but \"Hellboy\" shows that he has a surprising knack for directing action in a fluid manner without resorting to the cheap method of quick cutting. Also notable in terms of Del Toro's work here is how he subtly manages to pay homage to the memorable artwork of the comics, for example the overhead shots of Hellboy.The CGI effects are quite good considering the film's relatively modest budget, and thankfully they don't form the basis for much of this film. The cast are all solid if not fantastic, although Ron Perlman is probably the best actor I can think of to play Hellboy. The final shot is beautiful and perfectly in keeping with the pulp poetry of not only this film but also the comics it is based on. 8/10",

    "plot": "The filming of the Helm's Deep sequences was so grueling and went on for so many months, that Jackson gave all the extras a free T-shirt to commemorate the experience. There were so many extras that they would often recognize each other other extras in New Zealand's main cities, by wearing the shirts. On the front of the shirt was the statement \"I Survived Helm's Deep\", with the letter M is struck out, indicating \"hell\" of the experience. Two versions existed. One was in black, with red printing on the back that read \"Lord of the Rings\nUruk-Hai Battalion\", The other was in blue with silver printing on the back that read \"The Lord of the Rings \"Elf Regiment\".",
    "review": "Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word \"epic\" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.10/10",

The off color humor comes from many things that kids in the age group really go through.I grew up attending Catholic High School. So I can related to many things in this movie. Just the uniforms alone are funny. And the characters of the Priests and Nuns are very funny, and reminds me of many of the teachers I had back in the day.Yes both Molly and Will were a little too old for their characters. I wonder what the movie would have been like if they made it with child actors. It certainly would have been a whole different thing. But I like how they made it with the older actors. It's Molly Shannon's character and really no one but Molly can play her.",

The biggest surprises in the film. besides the amazing dexterity of Sam Mendes at his first outing behind the camera, are West Bentley. Chris Cooper, Thora Brch and Allison Janney. As I'm writing this 8 years after its first release, the Oscars and the whole hullabaloo, I'm very surprised that West Bentley hasn't become a major star. He is amazing in \"American Beauty\" the complexities of his character are based on recognizable human stands, the hardest to face up to and I went where he went. Thora Birch is lovely as the object of his attention and the film, I believe, is here to say.",

It narrates the events through 4 characters coming from different faiths and social classes.Maroun Baghdadi takes a slow-burn approach and naturally presents the events of the last days before the Civil War through conversations from different perspectives.

His prediction was right, and the beautiful Beirut was filled with mushroom smokes a year later.There are so many great scenes in the film, and it is also incredibly intense on an emotional level without artificially exaggerated or manipulative. What is astonishing is the use of music and it helps in stringing together impressive scenes. You can't really sum up with few about the film itself, because if you look at it more closely, it's a misfired gem considering the budget and the political timeline. Despite the shortcomings mentioned, it is astonishing to witness the glory days of Beirut with great acting and solid soundtrack that radiates the melancholic mood. Highly recommended if you love world Cinema and respect an acute vision, do not skip this sincere effort of filmmaking. I would recommend it to arthouse fans, also check out his other films.

    "plot": "When Dennis Greene, who played Reggie, showed up for shooting, he was told by Martin Lawrence's bouncer that he mustn't look into Lawrence's eyes or talk to him, and Lawrence himself was subsequently nasty to him. It was all a ploy arranged by Director Michael Bay who wanted the boy to be genuinely scared of Lawrence. Greene also wasn't told about the gun that he would be threatened with.",
    "review": "It must be awesome being Michael Bay. I mean, can you imagine any other director who is given mega-budgets every few weeks and told to blow up more than he did in his previous movies? In the first Bad Boys film an air-plane hanger was blown to bits and was swiftly followed by an asteroid being nuked in Armageddon and the destruction of Pearl Harbour in...uh, Pearl Harbour. Not to be undone, Bad Boys 2 has him indulging in not one, but two chaotic car chases where muscle cars which most of us would spend our lives saving up for are torn to pieces like yesterday's newspapers and rounding everything up by detonating a sizable part of Cuba. If this trend continues, there won't be a building left standing in the whole of North America once Transformers is through. Not bad for a smug little geek with a rubbish haircut.If you've seen the first Bad Boys film, you'll know what to expect. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return as Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, a pair of loose cannon cops whose only similarities are their penchants for arguing and getting into gun fights. Lowrey (Smith) is all laid back cool, stylin' and profilin' his way through the Miami underworld while charming the pants off every woman that crosses his path. Burnett on the other hand is an insecure, neurotic and over protective family man. Not only that, but he has a bit of an anger management problem as well and has been half a step away from a severe nervous breakdown for the majority of his adult life. So far, so very similar to any cop orientated buddy movie you've ever seen, but Bad Boys 2 overcomes the total lack of originality thanks to the natural charisma of the stars and the sheer spectacle of its action sequences.The plot of course is throw away guff designed to hurtle Smith and Lawrence into the thick of as many explosions as possible, but when they bounce off each other this well it's difficult to care. Martin Lawrence has never been a great leading man but somehow, when partnered with Will Smith his career makes perfect sense, his manic edginess being the perfect foil to Smith's effortless charm. You could argue that being on screen with the World's Most Charismatic Man would make anyone look good, but then you'd clearly not have seen the terrible I, Robot, where nobody looked good. Not even the robot.And then you have the aforementioned action sequences. Yes, we all know they're going to be over the top, but lord almighty, it's still an adrenaline pumping thrill to see them happen. The opening John Woo impression with the Ku Klux Klan is just the starter to a main course that consists of a destruction derby car chase, a close quarters battle with some Rastafarian gang members, a fist fight on a train carriage, ANOTHER insane car chase and a dessert set in Cuba, where a mansion gets destroyed. Throughout, bodies fly off overpasses to go crashing into glass phone boxes, men are riddled with machine gun fire and the balls of fire get bigger and more firey the later they appear. Bad Boys 2 might not be subtle, but it sure as hell is fun.However, there is a drawback: the running time. It might be an energetic exercise in flashy excess, but did it really need to be two and a half hours long? Entertaining though it is, there comes a point when you've seen enough faceless henchmen getting holes drilled in them and just want to see the villain being brought down. Given the extreme running time, isn't also a bit unusual that Joe Pantoliano's role as the best clich\u00e9d police chief in movie history is so small? Maybe they were worried he'd pack the movie into his bags and run off with them like he did the first time around...Those grumbles aside, there's little complaint to be made about Bad Boys 2. Sure, it's so shallow that I could just as easily have written \"Will Smith and Martin Lawrence destroy stuff\" and summed up the entire enterprise, but it makes for an exhilarating action movie and the natural successor to all those ones produced in the eighties when brain cells were exchanged for body counts and biceps. Try not to take it seriously and you'll have a blast.",

    "review": "I quite enjoyed Chaahat. It is obviously one of Mahesh Bhatt's worst commercial films, not because it is a very bad film but more because this director was responsible for some films which rank amongst the best of Hindi cinema and this one really pales in comparison, which is inevitable. Anyway, the film is pretty watchable, much more when one does not tend to take it too seriously. For the most part, the film flows very well and has its moments, but it gradually goes down as the writing gets more exaggerated. The film stars Shahrukh Khan as Roop, a guy who becomes the love interest of his cruel employer Ajay's young sister, named Reshma. She gets completely obsessed with him while he plans to marry Pooja, a simple nurse who looks after his ill father. The main problem is with Ajay, who warns Roop that he will go to any extents to make his sister happy. Yeh, quite a fairytale, but it's not that bad. Shahrukh Khan is brilliant as Roop as he was in most of his films of that time. Pooja Bhatt is charming and cute, Naseer is excellent as always in this ultra-negative role, and Ramya Krishna is absolutely beautiful and damn too hot to ignore. The music is nice and the title track \"Chaahat Na Hoti\" is very melodious. Chaahat must have had a wider message to it which for some reason I did not manage to understand (or maybe I just did not try to), but it was pretty engaging nonetheless. The last 15 minutes of the film with Khan going all mad and supernatural are ridiculous and plain embarrassing, but let it be, it is a nice Hindi entertainer and should provide a good time-pass for Shahrukh fans.",

My Family is German, in fact my grandparents were born in Germany, and I have always heard the horrible stories of the concentration camps and How my family was so ashamed to be German. I have seen many pictures and movies concerning the holocaust but nothing could have prepared me for the images shown in this movie. The videos taken of the concentration camp prisoners was so unbelievable. When the first survivor began talking I felt tears begin to rush down my face. The way the Nazi's treated these people was so unbelievable and horrible. Towards the end of the film we see the deceased prisoners of the camps being thrown into large pits of fire to destroy their bodies. At this point in the movie I literally began to gag from the horror of how these people was treated. This movie is life changing- I don't think I will ever be able to read a book about World War II or the holocaust with out feeling my own heartbreak. In my opinion the most touching moment is when we hear the story of how a woman keeps the diamonds her mother gave her secret from the Nazis, and how she still has them and what she has done with them. Another moment that broke my heart is the story of a woman who wears a bathing suit that her father gave her under her clothes to the concentration camp and how she was scared to take it off because she feared she would forget all the good times that she had had before the war.  I hope everyone sees this movie so they can understand what hate does, and so that nothing like this ever happens again.",

    "review": "The first encounter that I ever had with Paul Thomas Anderson was through \"Boogie Nights.\" I admit, I first saw it because of I heard that it was about the porn industry. However, I was surprised to discover an intimate look into the damaged lives of several very interesting, well-developed characters. I also was delighted to have found a new and exciting director whose career and films I will be sure to follow. Anderson's cinematic flamboyance, technical bravura, and inspired storytelling ability make him a talent who is emblematic of the resurrgence in creative and dynamic filmmaking that has occured in this past year. Like Fincher(Fight Club), Mendes(American Beauty), Jonze(Being John Malkovich), and the Wachowski Brothers(The Matrix), Anderson has created a truly unique film that stretches the boundaries of cinema.Many who I saw the movie with grumbled repeatedly about it's length. Clocking in at about three hours and ten minutes, \"Magnolia\" is long. Even if you are as strong an advocate of the film as I am, you will think that it is long. I really had to go to the bathroom the whole time. But I did not want to miss a single second of Mr. Anderson's fascinating opus. The prologue is very well done, doing a good job of drawing in the viewer. It makes an interesting commentary on coincidence, wjich segues nicely into the rest of the film. The first half hour of the film is the most wonderfully done I have ever seen. Just as Anderson does in \"Boogie Nights,\" the prodigy weaves a fast-paced web of intrigue, flashing tidbits of the many characters' lives that leave the viewer thirsty for more. The rhythm of the film slows down for the bulk of it, as we learn more and more and become more intimately involved in the lives of the wonderfully flawed characters. The film seems to build and build into something bigger than itself. In a way, that is the main flaw of it, but also the beauty of it. Anderson's ambitiousness is huge, but I wouldn't call him an overreacher.This film is so full of great performances. It is probably the best ensemble piece that I have witnessed. There has been much Oscar buzz on Tom Cruise's behalf, but I honestly believe that there are so many Oscar worthy performances in this film that it is a futile effort to mention them all.\nParticularly strong in the movie is the editing, which allows for the interconnected stories of the various characters to be placed parallel to each other very smoothly. The cinematography is wonderful, obviously influenced by Scorcese. I really don't believe that this film could have been as good as it was if it were any shorter. Seeing it is truly an experience. I was almost sad to see it end.",

    "review": "i anticipated this movie like i wait for any new JCVD film. i love van damme and i think he has a lot of potential, give him a 100 million dollars film and a director like michael bay, and watch how he captures the screen and the whole holywood. Universal soldier II is a nice action film, but lacks a lot of basic A film characteristics. van damme shows some good fighting, but mic rodgers didnt shoot'em right. he needs to learn some stuff from john woo's & van damme's HARD TARGET, except of the scene when van damme fights S.E.T.H. this scene is the greatest scene in the film. it was also nice to see bil goldberg's humor as a big hard-ass unisol being kick-assed by van damme in various parts of the movie. i was sad as the plot took a turn when the main computer S.E.T.H took control over the facility and sent over the unisols to take over the world or whatever. i think it could have been better, if the scripters would have think twice. in conclusion, wait for video, but don't miss this film at all, after all, van damme is van damme.",

    "review": "American novelist Brian Garfield wrote a popular novel'Death Wish' in 1972 which was adapted for a Hollywood movie of the same title and also for a TV series. The theme of this story contains the activities of somebody who has lost a lot in the hands of the criminals and thus developed a death wish in his heart. He wants to die but instead of dying in the normal way, he wants to die in his bid to eliminate as many criminals as he can. This story has inspired many novels and movies in India. Aakhiri Adaalat(1988) also seems to have been inspired by Death Wish only because it shows a group of public-spirited people who are aggrieved in their personal lives because of the criminals roaming about the society. Fostering death wish in their hearts, such people now fearlessly go after the criminals and eliminate them, terming it as the justice of their court(Adaalat).Aakhiri Adaalat(the final court) starts with a gang of hardcore criminals who have taken the city to ransom by their law-breaking activities. This gang consists of Girija Shankar(Paresh Rawal), Shiv Saran(Gulshan Grover), Bansidhar(Sarat Saxena), Mahaveer Shah(Girdhar), Raghunathan(Roopesh Kumar) etc. alongwith their henchmen. Honest and dutiful cop Inspector Amar(Vinod Khanna) is after them but his style of functioning is not liked by his seniors like the Deputy Superintendent of Police(Shafi Inaamdaar) and the Commissioner of Police(Sudhir Dalvi). The DSP himself is sold out in the hands of these criminals and helps them in different ways. Amar lives with his widow mother(Sushama Seth). Nitin Sinha(Jackie Shroff) is Amar's fast friend who lives with his widow mother Mrs. Sinha(Seema Dev). Nitin loves Nisha(Sonam) who is the daughter of Barrister Shankar Sharma(Vinod Mehra) who apparently does not like the affair of his daughter with Nitin. Amar and Barrister Sharma are also not on good terms because the criminals caught by Amar with a lot of effort are acquitted by the court due to the efforts of Barrister Sharma who pleads for them. To keep a vigil on Amar as well as to restrain his enthusiasm, the DSP gives him an assistant in the form of Sub-Inspector Reema(Dimple). However within a span of time, Amar and Reema fall in love.Suddenly a killing spree starts in the city against the criminals. The killer wears a specific leather jacket and a specific helmet covering his whole face and he arrives on a motorbike to take on the outlaws. Many criminals including some of the high profile gangsters mentioned above are killed by the biker. Since the identity of the killer is not known, it is also not clear whether it is the same person every time or just the get-up is the same used by different people on different occasions. Amar alongwith Reema is after this mysterious murderer but all his efforts go in vain. And the tragedy is that Amar himself comes under the suspicion of being this mysterious helmet-wearing biker who kills the criminals. First Reema suspects him because a similar leather jacket and a similar helmet is found in a closet of his bedroom, then after knowing the fact from Reema, Amar's mother also accuses him to be this mysterious killer. A disheartened and demoralized Amar who now feels as completely lonely in the world, leaves his own house. He gets suspended also by his department.To wash the stain of being the killer himself from his name, Amar investigates the things in his personal capacity and gradually some new and startling facts come to the fore. Amar comes to know now that the killer is not a single individual but there is a full-fledged organization populated by public-spirited people who hate crime and criminals. Different members of this group wear the publicized get-up of the killer, use the bikes and eliminate the criminals because they are disenchanted with the reigning judicial system which appears more to be in favour of the criminals than the law-abiding citizens. The reason behind this disenchantment and their rebellious attitude towards the society and the law is that they had not got justice from the same when they were aggrieved.They call their organization their own court in which they themselves play the roles of judge, jury and executioner together for the criminals who deserve the strictest punishment as per their philosophy of justice. They have lost their desire to live and it's the death wish in their hearts that has made them daredevil.On the other side, now only one gangster - Girija Shankar is left among his group because all others have been killed by the jacket and helmet wearing biker. He decides to use the myth of the helmet-wearing biker-killer now well-set in the public-psyche to his advantage. He starts killing the innocents while wearing that get-up and riding a bike, thus maligning the image of that mysterious-killer in public. Now the members of this unusual society have to prove that they do not kill innocents and some oversmart criminal is killing the innocents while hiding his true identity behind the get-up known to be belonging to them. They seek Amar's help in this regard though Amar considers it his duty to arrest them and handover to the law. In the end, the villain, i.e., Girija Shankar is caught by Amar with the help of the corrupt DSP(who has had a change of heart). However what the court established by the system and the law of the land decides for this self-designated court, remains a question which the filmmaker does not answer.The corrupt and ineffective judicial system of India in which the proceedings move at a snail's pace with no hope for justice for the victims, does not recognize such parallel courts or clandestine societies running a crusade against crime. But they may be welcome by the aggrieved and victimized underdog if they do emerge in India also the way they had emerged in many other countries long long back.",

    "review": "They say the great thing about Shakespeare's work is that it is so open to interpretation. Every director can bring his or her fresh eyes to a play and make it new. Even so, I think we are obliged to stay true to the basic tennents of the text. Are the works of Jane Austen as open to interpretation? Maybe, but I doubt it; Certainly not if MANSFIELD PARK is anything to go by.MANSFIELD was always my favourite of Austen's six novels. Many modern critics, while not denying its basic greatness, have problems with the book. Many find FANNY PRICE unlikeable, many find her judgemental, and feel that her Stoic, Augustan approach is hard to relate to. Stand-by, do nothing, and eventually he'll see the error of his ways and come to love you. Not very modern, is it?OK, so if you don't like the main character, if you don't like what she has to say, then what do you do? Look for other aspects of the story you can relate to. In recent years some critics have chosen to see MANSFIELD PARK in Post-Imperial terms, as a critique of Slavery. After all, the family's wealth is based on plantations in Antiga, which were run by slaves. Is that what the book's about? Is it? I don't know. I think the evidence is a little slim, but who am I to deny the possibility? Maybe it plays a part in the subtext of the novel.So, I'm a modern script-writer who doesn't like the novel, it's pre-occupations or even Fanny Price. What do I do? I completely re-write the story to take a possible minor sub-text (slavery) and turn it in to the driving narrative force. I then take smart as a whippet, stubborn yet passive Fanny and turn her into a ballsy version of Bridget Jones. With an attitude. I then string together a couple of scenes from the book with a few invented bridging scenes to advance the romance. Et Voila! I have a completely different story!I don't know what this film is, but it isn't Mansfield Park. Enjoy it on its own terms, but don't ever get the idea that your watching Austen on the screen. But, jeeze. I think that if you're going to adapt a novel for the screen, you ought to at least like the source material; Otherwise, what's the point? If you don't like the main character, you shouldn't be able to completely re-invent her. Or if you do, you should have the decency to be a little ashamed.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

It is a testament to John Travolta's genius that his career survived this disaster at all.As they say, garbage-in, garbage out. Start with an L Ron Hubbard novel (your first mistake) featuring a completely plagiarized dark-skinned, war-like and hairy alien culture with wrinkly foreheads (if this sounds like Klingons to you, I thought so too!), and add unfortunate Barry \"can't get a break\" (or maybe it should be 'cant pick a script') Pepper and all you need is Travolta himself - playing the arrogant, merciless, slightly effeminate and quite under-sized leader of the alien colonists. Remove any hint of character development from the script and use the worst of the worst black box technobabble explanations for plot devices. Finally, stay true to the idiotic gibberish you based the film on in the first place, and you've got the makings of a rolling-on-the-floor comedy.In fact, opening night, in a packed theater, people started laughing out loud about 20 minutes into the film and never really stopped. We had a great time that night. Halfway through the film more than half the crowd was actually interacting with the film, asking \"Mr Worf, where's Commander Riker?\" and asking troublesome questions about how many hundreds of years gas would remain viable in the gas-tank of a Harrier.If you need to know about the plot - it's this simple - Earth has been conquered by an amazingly stupid group of Klingon-like aliens, and the remaining humans live in a large domed slave labor camp where they are taught that their sole purpose is servitude because they are stupid, weak, etc. Barry Pepper somehow becomes convinced that he's not born to be a slave, and learns to fly a harrier, etc. It's really not worth the effort of typing. There are a few not-so-subtle and not very original but good messages about ethnocentrism to be found here, but not much else.

    "review": "The title \"Ghulam-E-Musthafa\" translates into \"slave of God,\" and this epic study of one man's inner struggle with his violent upbringing versus his devout religious beliefs, is truly something to behold. Musthafa, as a young street orphan, is adopted by a political crime boss, whom the boy calls Abba, or \"father.\" The Muslim youth is trained to be a killer, and grows into a quiet, lonely man who knows little more than killing, and prayer. A volatile mix, and when a chance encounter with a beautiful nightclub dancer awakens human emotion in Musthafa, he is forced to re-think his life, and how Allah expects him to live. When a car bomb, planted by a rival crime family, takes the life of his woman, Musthafa takes it as a sign from God, and sets about changing his ways. But not before a deliriously stylish and violent revenge is carried out on the men who took the life of his beloved. As with many Bollywood films, \"Ghulam-e-Mustapha\" is rich with many different genres. Powerful drama, political espionage, and romance go hand in hand with comedy, brutal violence, and... musical numbers! However don't expect a light, sugar-coated film here; this is some serious stuff indeed, and the few music set pieces are cleverly integrated into the film without sacrificing authenticity; those segments are either nightclub performances or fantasy scenes, and the actors don't break out in song, rather the songs are there as a backdrop. The first portion of the film introduces us to the highly developed characters, and sets up the events to come. the second portion, when Musthafa moves into the home of a proud Hindu family, and the struggle that develops over religious beliefs and customs, is both fitfully funny and profoundly touching, and the final portion features some surprising violence, and a shocking ending that you will never forget. This one will be quite a discovery for fans of great, if obscure cinema, and it's topic of Islam is quite timely now. In fact 'Ghulam' serves as a beautiful example, and sheds light on the most misunderstood religion on Earth, by portraying a deeply sympathetic Muslim male, who has a profound love and respect for the lives of others, regardless of religion. In the tradition of DePalma's \"Scarface,\" \"Ghulam-e-Musthafa\" is an epic tale of violence, power, greed, and redemption.",

This movie correctly focused the viewer's attention on the evil and devious-in fact squalid- aim of the Japanese military in its totalitarian goals. The Japanese military was ultimately defeated. Thank you God. Now, we live in peace. It all seems a big misundertanding. The Japanese People had a Big Rising Sun on their flag. We, the Americans, dropped a big nuclear sun on two of their cities.

I didn't want to get out of my seat.  And once I got out of the theatre, I couldn't even talk about it for an hour or so.  I kept running the details over and over in my head.  It's rare that a film has such an impact on me.  The cinematography was stunning.  The special effects were beautifully done.  The characters' moves were effortless.  The acting was wonderful.  I really think that Michelle Yeoh should have been nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress.  I thought that the effects and storyline complimented each other brilliantly.  There were so many different layers to the plot.  There were many things that couldn't be explained with dialogue that were expressed in the characters' faces.  This film had lighthearted moments, heartwrenching moments, romantic interludes, inspirational sentiments, wonderful plot twists, superb acting, beautifully done fight scenes, never before seen special effects...it had it all.  Some scenes may have been a little over the top, but it's *fantasy*... and yet, after a few brief moments, it somehow became completely believable. That's how much this film draws you in.  This is a one of a kind film; there is just no comparing it to any other.  It transports you to another place and time.   I highly recommend it.",

    "review": "There are a lot of good things about 28 Days, especially from Sandra Bullock and Betty Thomas (Director). Don't be fooled by the advertisers and trailers, this movie is a drama. There is a little comedy thrown in the mix to keep things light at times (after all, rehab is a depressing subject), but the balance is about 80/20% in favor of drama.Sandra really shines. This movie is all hers and she proves that while bubbly and energetic may be her niche, she can also be gritty and subtle to great effect. She's always been a very solid and dependable actress, but she gets to dig deeper here. She could have played this role in so many ways that would have been easy and predictable, but luckily she gave just the right amount of weight to her character. It's certainly her best acting performance.Betty Thomas also delivers another strong effort. The pacing and amount of scene time seem just right. There is very interesting camera work and flashback scenes that work very well. I guess the best thing to say is that she made a formula movie (girl bottoms out, girl resists rehab, girl comes to terms and embraces recovery) without boring us with the formula.In short, the best thing about the movie is what it wasn't. It could have been so cliched (although there were a couple of unavoidable ones) and paint-by-numbers. Instead, it was more subtle rather than over the top.There are good performances by all, especially Steven Buscemi who plays his small role straight and somber. This film has higher artistic/merit value than it does entertainment value (afterall, how entertaining can a movie about rehab be?). It's a solid 7.",

That's about the simple horror of Final Destination, and it was done in almost artistic ways.While many movie-makers have been unwilling or unable to get into the meat & potatoes behind a good R-rated movie, the creators of Final Destination have no such restraint.  In fact, the death scenes were so freakishly violent and intricate that they were interesting in and of themselves.  Imagine the force of death (not the Grim Reaper, but the \"phenomenon of accidents\", if you will) being MAJORLY p***ed for having missed a few.  Hence the plot.To make matters worse, the director displayed \"the little things\" hyper-accurately.  That alone made watching it really hard at times without wincing, flinching or screaming out loud.  (*those who have seen this know EXACTLY what I'm talking about*)As someone who goes to the movies every Friday, I have been waiting for this FOREVER!!Oh, and by movie, I mean MOVIE...  not FILM, not INDIE, not FLICK.

They don't make them like this too often.Don't get me wrong, I'm sure if you were looking for flaws you could find them (no movie is perfect), but I wasn't and enjoyed my ride thoroughly as a result.  Personally, I think that if you had the time to pay attention to those flaws while watching it for the very first time, I've got news for you:  you missed a great movie.",

If you knew something, you would have realized that any film that begins with a cameo from Edward Said must be somewhat worthwhile (Or at least play with some interesting ideas). Yes, this movie is firmly situated within the romantic-melodramatic genre common in Egyptian cinema. Cinema is at its root a popular entertainment, and many of the greatest masterpieces of American cinema (which most world cinemas have been trying, with varying degrees of success, to emulate since the 30's) were produced in a similar context. What is 'Casablanca' if not a melodrama? Egyptian cinema likewise operates within the framework of melodrama, and utilizes these conventions to tell stories which have a deeper meaning. Watch 'Du'at al-Karawan,' 'la anam,' 'sigara wa ka's', etc... and tell me that's not art. Youssef Chahine has experimented with auteur-style film-making (Iskandriyah leih?) but he also -like Barakat and the best of the Egyptian directors before him, knows how to exploit the narrative tropes of the melodrama genre to create art. So leave your film-festival snobbery at the door and enjoy. 'Al-Akhar' is not Chahine's best film (in my opinion, that's Bab al-Hadid) but it is a well-told story which also takes a frank look at Egyptian society and the complex relationship between the West and the Arab world.",

    "review": "Come on, I know it's not cool to admit to liking what is essentially a cheesy teen flick. But go ahead, say it aloud - this is a fun movie! Sappy, badly acted, full of exaggerated clich\u00e9s and one-liner groaners, Center Stage nevertheless has a kind of charm to it. No, it's not an Oscar contender or a change-your-life kind of movie. This is pure escapism, plain and simple. But - say it together with me now - there's nothing wrong with that.Amanda Schull plays Jody, a wannabe ballet dancer who gets accepted to the prestigious American Ballet Academy. The movie follows her life and that of her friends and fellow students, who fall into the predictable stereotypes. There's Eva (Zoe Saldana), the city kid with attitude. There's Maureen (Susan May Pratt), the teacher's pet. There's Erik (Shakiem Evans), the gay guy. There's Cooper (Ethan Stiefel), the bad-boy celebrity who's still in love with the director's wife ballerina. There's Charlie (Sascha Radetsky), the perfect good guy. One has the obnoxious stage mom. Another has the talent but not the drive. A third has the drive but not the talent. Etcetera. And the lives of the students take the typical high school romantic twists and turns, as the students compete for one of three spots in the company by the end of the year, and also in the various love triangles between the cast. There are few surprises here.None of the cast is much of an actor - Schull is particularly uneven - and the plot has a sort of predictability to it that make eyes roll.So why the 8/10? Well, because despite all this, Center Stage is a great amount of fun - mostly due to the dancing.By casting real dancers in a lot of the roles, Center Stage lends an air of credibility to the lavishly filmed dance sequences, clearly done with love by such talents as world-leading dancers Julie Kent and Ethan Stiefel (widely considered to be one of the best ballet dancers in the world) as well as relatively new talents such as Amanda Schull. Some of the actors have body doubles dancing for them, such as Zoe Saldana - who had some dance training but not at the level required by the film. But overall, the dance scenes are the best part of the movie, especially Cooper's ballet at the end.Some movies are great because they change your life or make you think. Center Stage is great because it's like candy - full of saccharine sugar and empty calories, but eminently watchable over and over again. Sometimes movies don't have to be socially relevant or intellectually stimulating to be good. Sometimes, escapism is OK too.",

    "review": "So narrates Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) standing by the boss Bill the Butcher's side (Daniel Day-Lewis) at the height of his hard-boiled reign over New York City in the mid-1800's. Amsterdam saw the Butcher brutally kill his father in a gang-war when he was just a little boy, and he's sworn revenge ever since. But in order to get his vengeance, he must infiltrate the Butcher's gang, and ends up becoming something of a son to him.That \"Gangs of New York\" is such a good film is a mystery because it breaks the fundamental rule of good film-making: you have to care for the central character, and DiCaprio's Amsterdam is an unlikeable young man. He is surly and unkind, walking around in a bubble of hesitation and scattered thoughts of revenge. He moodily snarls at the one woman he likes (Cameron Diaz). It is inconceivable how someone as dynamic, likable and strong as the Butcher would ever take this brat in, but that's film for you.The above is an unfortunate miss; the lead character has to be strong or else the film will weigh him down. Juxtaposing Dicaprio with Day-Lewis has got to be the worst idea that's ever popped into Scorsese's mind because it is evident within minutes of the film that they are of very different acting fibre and the former will look even WORSE when paired with one of the best working actors in the world today. But these are mere casting flaws (but still harmful), so onto the overall direction:A friend of mine once said that Martin Scorsese is only capable of half a film before it turns into a mess and that stuck with me when I watched \"Gangs of New York\", because it was true. This is a relatively straightforward story of revenge but it is diluted by detours in Irish traditions \u0096 there's singing, dancing, bareknuckled fighting, drinking and debauchery--for 2 and a half hours. These detours may be well sewn-together by a patient Scorsese narrative flow (I'm thinking \"Casino\") told by Amsterdam, but is unnecessary to go to such lengths to get the Irish-immigrant setting and mood. We already got it, so move on and give us more substance.However it cannot be denied that many of these detours make the film and setting \u0096 they are beautifully illustrated by lush colours that seem to bleed off screen\u0096primary colours to suit primary, instinct-driven and hard-boiled men. The cinematography is just staggering. New York City is gritty, corrupt, bloody and bare-knuckled. I mean, I have seen Tarantino, Stone, Kramer and Cronenberg but this is by far the most violent and gory film I have ever watched. Such poignant, effective fights.It is a shame the rest of the film is not as poignant, but desperately diluted. What saves it is Day-Lewis' magnificent presence on-screen as the brutal Butcher Bill, the occasional portrayals of gang-culture and the almost all-star ensemble cast that pop up in supporting roles throughout. A good film (just barely), but nothing more. \"7\" may be too generous, but hey...7/10",

I thought that all such romantic horror films should take on similar cinematography to make the film beautiful.However, when I watched Nang Nak after graduation, I really salute to the director for making such a beautiful story. The story behind the legend was true, and it was the perfect choice of the director to choose the production of this film as a love-story instead of a horror movie.Basically it all started out of love, the love of a woman to her man, bearing his child and yet, before they could get together again as a family, they had to be separated by heaven and earth as she dies during child birth. The female lead did a wonderful job to be so constrained, so soft and almost to the point of pitiful loving which makes it truly understandable why she could not leave her husband despite her death.To intensify her longing to be with her husband, we saw how she was robbed off her belongings at the point of her death while she was giving birth, a young woman who had to bear the pain of childbirth without the support of her husband by her side. During that time, there were no modern hospital facilities and giving birth in itself is a dangerous labor of love. Her courage beaten, her life taken, and yet she had not been able to see her husband for the last time.It is no wonder that such a loving woman would bring her child along with her to meet with her husband once more, just so that they can live together again as a happy family. Everyone in this world hopes for such a happy family life and yet this very basic human right had been taken away from her. Despite her coming back to haunt the village, as a viewer I can only pity her for her everlasting love for her husband and her strong will to keep herself within this realm of existence just to be with him, defying all laws of nature.",

This angered Sunny Deol as the idea behind the script had come from him. He felt betrayed by Santoshi. Sunny decided to make another film titled \"Ajay\" with Suneel Darshan instead.",
    "review": "Pukar aka \"The Call\" is a movie about how a soldier (Jaidev played by Anil Kapoor) raises to the occasion whenever his nation calls irrespective of his personal issues. What makes Pukar interesting is that, inside the story there is also a different kind of pukar, the call from a dear one (Anjali played by Madhuri Dixit) who truly loves him but he does not feel or see or responds to her love. Rajkumar Santhoshi blends these two \"pukar\"s very nicely with right amount of emotion, beautiful visuals, stunts and, entertains us for about 3hrs.Anil Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit have given first rate commendable performances. The chemistry between them is not like their earlier youthful movies (Tezaab, Ram Lakhan etc.), it is more restrained, mature and appealing. Definitely it is one of the best of Anil-Madhuri combination. It could have been little better if Anil Kapoor looked a bit younger. Though, Om Puri as Colonel Hussein and Rohini Hatangadi as Mrs. Mallappa have little screen presence, they have played their role very well. Rest of the acting crew has supported well. I felt Girish Karnad, an actor of high calibre has been wasted in this movie.A. R. Rahman's music is OK. The songs are hummable especially \"Kay Sera Sera\" and \"Sunta Hai Mera Khuda\", but the background score does not leave any lasting impression. The choreography of the song \"Kay Sera Sera..\" is commendable. The visuals and locations are beautiful. Rajkumar Santhoshi's direction is crisp and good, but it is not in the league of his previous best movies Ghayal and Damini. The story remains on its track all the time, there are no subplots and, unlike usual bollywood movies does not digresses into unnecessary petty comedies, emotions, and remarks about any particular country or organization.The main weak point of the movie is that the story is not air tight: 1. The way the commando operation is carried out to save the minister shows that the army already knew Abhrush's hide out and so, they could have done it well before. 2. Anjali as daughter of an army personnel should have known the meaning or consequence of leaking confidential information. 3. Army intelligence work is downplayed. Logically, when Om Puri is killed in such a \"big\" terrorist attack, there should have been an inquiry and, that would have lead to the cancellation of the independence day function due to security risk.Inspite of these flaws, Santhoshi's direction and dialogues keep the attention of the viewer till the end. The first half of the movie is fast paced but the pace weakens in the second half. If you want to watch a quality commercial movie with good acting, visuals, and dialogues then I would recommend it.",

    "review": "I don't understand why many people I talked to either thought the film was bad or mediocre.  Sure, it isn't a \"great\" movie, but when was the last time you saw 5 great movies in a row?  A great movie comes along once in a blue moon, depending on your definition of great.  I personally was very engaged in the plot.  Johnny Depp gives a tour-de-force performance, fully engaging himself in the character.  I'm sure he did lots of research on George Jung and tried to mimick his every mannerism, because this was far from a half-baked effort.  Then again, I don't ever recall Johnny Depp doing a movie where he didn't put his full enthusiasm into the role.  The movie has many tragic moments and many funny moments.  The film is a little over 2 hours long, but the time flew by in a breeze.  I was so enlightened that I'm anxious to do some research on the real George Jung.  I'm not a fan of Penelope Cruz, and they could've chosen a much better actress, but she's only in the film about 20 or 30 minutes, so she isn't given enough time to ruin the film.  Paul Reubens gives a surprisingly earnest performance as a flamboyant, bisexual hairdresser.  It's too bad he's caught up in all this controversy, because he seems to have sufficient range as an actor.  I loved hearing all the great classic rock songs in the soundtrack, and every time I watch the film the songs get stuck in my head and I start singing them for days on end.  \"Blow\" is a touching drama that doesn't try to exploit the world of drugs, nor condemn it.  After seeing George's tragic outcomes as a world-class coke dealer, I doubt anyone would want to get in or get back into the \"business,\" but that doesn't necessarily mean the message is preachy. \nMy score:  8 (out of 10)",

    "review": "Its a movie which tries to encompass love, comedy, and dark comedy. But it seldom happens that all three can be added effectively into one flick.The movie starts from the light- hearted professional rivalry of Shah Rukh Khan and Juhi Chawla, turns into a love story somewhere in the middle, and then turns into a a vitriolic satire on the society, system and law. The strongest part of this movie is the direction (a director ought to be a good story teller and Aziz Mirza excels in it.) and of course, the music by Jatin- Lalit ranges from an average to the Excellent, especially in songs like \"aur kya...\".Shah Rukh Khan, in some scenes overacts, while Juhi constantly maintains her performance level, Paresh Rawal is extremely wonderful as the convict, he represents the common man, and steals the scenes from SRK and Juhi. Dilip Tahil and Satish Shah are too good as epicentres of laughter while Johnny Lever is just OK. Bottom Line: A feel good movie.",

Just don't think too hard about the plot, or you might fall through some of the gigantic holes. Shah Rukh Khan is perfect as a kid-hating, shoot-first-ask-questions-later cop, and Jackie Shroff is excellent (as always) as his older partner. Juhi Chawla provides most of the comedy with her character.Just when I started getting bored with the cliche'd Hollywood-style action, the story turned into a neat little family drama, with Shah Rukh and Juhi playing nursemaid to a bunch of bratty kids. I thought it was entertaining and charming.The A.R. Rahman music is trite in places, but features some really outstanding numbers, too, especially the comic \"I'm Sorry\" number with SRK and Juhi and the kids, and the lovely and romantic \"Sona Nahi Nah Sahi.\"This isn't a great film, it's true, but it entertained me for two and a half hours.

The dubious alliance, arranged by Nick's longtime friend and fence, Max (Marlon Brando, Don Juan deMarco), throws a wrench into Nick's plan to retire from crime and settle down with his lady love, Diane (Angela Bassett, Supernova).Uh-huh. The old, \"One more job, then I'll retire,\" routine. But that's where the routine ends. The trio of brilliant lead actors transcend the plot, and overcome the sometimes sluggish direction (courtesy of Frank Oz, who did Bowfinger and many other comedies -- and children's flicks, such as The Indian in the Cupboard). It's an absolute pleasure from start to finish, just to watch and study these men -- but then, they could probably be taking turns reading the phone book and make it seem fascinating. (Angela Bassett is excellent too, but she is unfortunately relegated to the one-dimensional, obligatory \"girlfriend role\" here.)The score is a big one: a 16th century royal scepter worth $30 million dollars. It's locked away in the basement of The Customs House in Montreal, Canada, and security is getting tighter by the day. Jackie infiltrates the House, posing as \"Brian,\" a janitor afflicted with cerebral palsy. Norton is flawless in his dual roles (remember his schizo debut in Primal Fear?), and better still, he plays Brian as funny and endearing without ever creeping into caricature-ville. Meanwhile, Nick is figuring out how to bypass the ironclad security system and crack the uncrackable safe. DeNiro doesn't have a lot to do with his character, but what he was given, he runs with. He not only makes you believe the clich\u00e9s, you like them, dammit. Brando is clearly having fun with his role -- one tailor-made just for him. \"I wrote the part specifically for Brando,\" said co-writer Kario Salem. \"I imagined him as a cross between Truman Capote and Tennessee Williams -- someone of great flamboyance and humor and wit and someone of great size, both literally and figuratively.\" Brando nails it all the way. (Interesting aside: the roles of Nick and Jackie were originally slated for Michael Douglas and Ben Affleck.)The twist ending is given away a bit too early (but then there's another twist), and there isn't anything here we haven't seen before. However, with three generations of the world's best actors on the screen, The Score scores big.",

    "plot": "The Thumb-Thumbs are based on a drawing that Robert Rodriguez did as a child.",
    "review": "Robert Rodriguez is not the first person you'd suggest to make a children's film. As entertaining as 'Desperado', 'The Faculty' and 'From Dusk Till dawn' are, you wouldn't line them up alongside 'Toy Story 2' and 'The Jungle Book' for good, old-fashioned family entertainment. Yet, as this energetic, light-hearted Bondesque spoof proves, Rodriguez has the talent to turn his hand to just about anything, and inject it with the suspense and adrenalin that are his trademark.From the gloriously OTT opening scene (which tells the story of how two agents sent to kill each other fall in love and settle down) to the last second, 'Spy Kids' doesn't miss a trick. The obligatory gizmos, mad villains and dastardly plot to take over the world are all there, along with a star cast all playing their roles with tongues firmly in cheek. The action/humour mix is extremely well-balanced too, with some hilarious visual gags sitting within a sharp script and Banderas, in particular, revels taking a sly swipe at his normal 'strong yet silent Latino' image. Yet, refreshingly for a children's film, it's never patronising, never obvious, and genuinely original in places (soldiers made of thumbs, secret agents transformed into tellytubby-type TV characters - imagine Goldeneye-meets-Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory-meets-Any Tim Burton film and you'll be close). In truth, some of the surreal moments and the more graphic effects may get a little too much for younger kids at times, but these moments are few and far between. Ok, it's a 'U' certificate and you may well have to sit through the trailer for 'See Spot Run', but don't let that put you off. This is one of the better films you'll see this year, and the best out over Easter by quite a way. Go and have some fun.8/10",

But they did.  The Wachowskis have way out done the new \"Star Wars\" films and without a doubt have far surpassed the \"X-Men films.\"   At times the dialogue is clunky and the Zion scenes are a little too Star Trek and Buck Rogers, but the action is always astonishing, and the humor is always in the right place...if not too much in the right place...For example Neo uses one of the many Agent Smiths to take down other Agent Smiths sending them all crashing with the sound of falling bowling pins.

The plot is a bit confusing and the premise long, but essentially this movie is about adultery. Raja Kumar Bahadur falls in love with a woman named Saudamani. He brings her home and renames her Madhuri but he does not marry her. Afterwards, he ends up marrying a woman named Sumita in order to pay off her debts and free her in a bargain. The film starts off pretty funny and has some good scenes, but overall it's not great and does not have anything that makes it stand out from other films. I've watched other Bollywood films that I found easier to follow and enjoyed more than this film and was surprised at the ratings this movie received. The one thing that I really did enjoy about this film was the acting of the star, Hema Malini. You might enjoy this film if you like classic Bollywood dramas, but if you are not a fan of this genre, you may not enjoy this film. Since it's in Hindi, if you are not fluent in the language, you will have to watch it with subtitles and therefore the film requires more of your attention span. It's also quite long, spanning over 2 hours which is long by Hollywoods standards, but short by Bollywood's standards. I'm not sure why all Bollywood films are musicals, but if you have watched Bollywood movies before, it won't be a surprise to you that this film is also a musical.

Accompanied by very appropriate techno-musik, the action sequences are fast and Euro-flashy, heavily influenced by Jan De Bont--different from the weird, drawn-out, \"suspended/string puppet\" thing that apparently passes for martial arts these days.

    "review": "Anybody should know when you're getting ready to see a Steven Seagal movie you're not getting ready to see a Greek tragedy.  What makes \"Exit Wounds\" special is it's all in good fun.  There's no pretentions whatsoever.  In fact, it even leaves a good share of the running time for comic relief.  You have spectacular action in one corner...you have hilarious comedy in the other...what the hell more can you ask for?  Seagal hasn't made an action flick in a while, so it was great to see him again on the silver screen.  He takes a lot of flack for gaining a little weight.  OK, so he's heavier than normal.  So maybe him and Sammo Hung been hanging out in the same buffet.  But Seagal can still kick butt like he did back in \"Above the Law\" and \"Hard to Kill.\"  His action scenes are always fun to watch.  As I tell people, I'm not easily aroused by action scenes.  I can be just as bored by an action scene as one would get bored during an episode of \"Masterpiece Theater.\"  But Seagal's action scenes have a sense of originality and flare.  Big deal.  He's not the best actor.  Does his work require great dramatic acting?  Would a dramatic monologue be appropriate during one of HIS movies?  Let's be sensible.  I think people are way too hard on the man.  He's still cool with me.In the comedy department, we have the uninhibited Tom Arnold.  Arnold plays the stereotypical cheesy talk show host, who takes anger-management classes with Seagal.  There's a hilarious scene where Seagal loses his temper and throws a fit, yelling to the teacher \"I'm a happy person!\" with anger in his eyes.  Then Arnold decides that Seagal would be a perfect guest for his show.  Also, we have Anthony Anderson of \"Me Myself and Irene\" fame.  He was one of the foul-mouthed African-American brothers in the Farrelly Brothers comedy.  He gets an even bigger opportunity to flaunt his comic chops in this flick.  In fact, him and Tom Arnold have a hysterically funny conversation at the end credits, so PLEASE don't be so quick to walk out the theater.  DMX is not a terrific actor, but he's fairly good.  He proves his discipline as an actor in a more restrained role than his starring role in Hype Williams' \"Belly.\"  In that film, he pretty much portrayed a character out of all his rap videos.  So that wasn't a big stretch.  \"EW\" gives him more to work with.  Not the role of a lifetime, but meatier than a drug-dealing \"gangsta.\"  And did I mention Jill Hennesy is in the cast?  Oh...mannnnn! She is an absolute knockout!  Perfect eye candy!  Throw in a gratuitous strip club scene(which this film has), and we have the ultimate guy flick. With DMX in the lead, naturally we have to expect some of his songs on the soundtrack.  And he provides some good stuff.  One--which was used in the previews and thankfully was used in the movie too--is a remix of \"Ain't No Sunshine When She's Gone.\"  It's quite innovative how they insert an artist's songs into a movie's soundtrack.  There's also a scene where DMX is picking out a car and blasts on the stereo his song \"Why Do Good Girls Love Bad Guys.\"  There isn't much depth to \"Exit Wounds.\"  In fact, I don't know if there's any depth.  But a film like this is meant strictly for exhibition.  And in that department, it really really delivers!  It's exciting!  It's funny! It's rousing!  It's a thrill a minute!  You won't be bored for a second!  An hour and thirty minutes of sheer, uninhibited fun!  \"Exit Wounds\" won't have you heading to the exit.  In fact, you probably won't even want to go out for popcorn you'll be having such a great time!  Strap in!My score:  7 (out of 10)",

    "review": "While less isn't always more, the makers of \"Stuart Little 2\" resisted the temptation to pad it out from its shorthand running time, meaning it goes by quickly and painlessly. Not that the actual plot of this followup to the original charmer is hard to take in itself (Stuart is starting to feel a bit left out, and when Margalo the wren literally drops into his life he gets a new dimension).In terms of technical levels it's only slightly easier to fault (Margalo looks a bit too cartoonish to be real, unlike Stuart Little himself and the falcon that's the movie's villain - but then again, Melanie Griffith [the voice of Margalo] always seems like a cartoon anyway), but the story by screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin and the movie's producer Douglas Wick is what makes this ultimately inferior to its predecessor; what helped drive \"Stuart Little\" was our hero's wish to be accepted by his human brother and by the cat - sneer all you want, but the family message was hard to ignore. For the sequel it's more standard - the friend who's acting out of ulterior motives at first but then turns out to be a real friend, etc. Stuart isn't so much the protagonist this time, and it hurts a little.So the freshness is reduced, but this still isn't stale - the charm and humour of the first movie remains, Michael J. Fox and Nathan Lane are as adept as ever as Stuart and Snowbell (\"This better be important.\" \"Margalo is missing.\" \"I'd better be more specific - I meant important to ME.\"), and the human Littles remain just right - loving but not without making you want to slit your own throats. HBO Family has recently aired an animated version with all the principals except Hugh Laurie absent - it'll have to go a long way to live up to the two movies. (In-joke for score fans: Alan Silvestri slips in a quote from his \"Back to the Future\" theme in the climax.)But I can see why this didn't do as well at the box-office as it should have - having a soccer match plus including Gilbert O'Sullivan AND Celine Dion on the soundtrack was asking for trouble...",

    "review": "On paper the casting here looked enough to guarantee big box office returns. Even if John Travolta has come off the back of the biggest flop of his career with \"Battlefield Earth\" Hugh Jackman was following up his first stint as Wolverine in \"X-Men\" likewise Halle Berry was following up the same movie. While Don Cheadle was in the Oscar winning \"Traffic\", Vinnie Jones was in \"Snatch\" and the remake of \"Gone in 60 Seconds\". But for some reason it just doesn't come together. Plot In A Paragraph: Gabriel Shear (John Travolta) is trying to access information that is locked inside a complicated computer system that contains mountains of government secrets - and money. With the help of his companion Ginger (Halle Berry) he hires Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman), a desperate computer expert, who is trying to stay clean to help him hack into the system. I'll get what I dislike out of the way first. Halle Berry's much hyped first topless scene looks very forced, and looks to only be in the movie for publicity purposes. John Travolta gives an awful performance and following \"The Punisher\" the last movie I watched him in, this is another hint that \"Pulp Fiction\" was a fluke. Tate Donovan is an awful actor, but thank funny his role is small. I'm not sure why Vinnie Jones is here, as I don't recall him having any dialogue, except an awful bit at the end. Despite a short running time, the plot is drawn out, and seems to have too much going on at the same time. Where the movie works is Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry. Jackman is a likable hero, both handsome and charismatic while also having the ability to actually act! Berry looks great and does as well as the material allows.Could have been worse, but also it could have been a hell of a lot better.",

You won't need to wear a fake smile while watching it. A smile will come on your face automatically. Each and every character was so beautiful. A cute family has been created so beautifully by Hrishikesh Mukherjee that everyone desires to tell but nobody tells. This movie is remade but that was so awful. I don't know why the new one is made?

    "review": "This is a very different Mexican film. One in which you can really appreciate the sure hand of director Alfonso Cuaron working at the top of his form with an excellent group of actors, which proves that when someone of this magnitude decides to make a good film about interesting characters in contemporary Mexico, one can expect a fine finished product.Alfonso and Carlos Cuaron have created people and situations that are very believable. The script is fine. \"Y tu mama tambien\" is about awakening and about reaching maturity. It's a great Mexican Road movie done with a lot of care.The Cuarons shows us a slice of life that could happen, not only in that country, but one that is universal. Producers and directors in Mexico should see this film and learn how to do future movies, even though the popular taste runs into the horrible soap operas, popular in Mexican TV. The Cuarons have turned out a magnificent script and have turned away from those popular melodramas that are a staple of the film industry of our neighbor to the South.Gael Garcia Bernal, who was excellent in Amores Perros, here demonstrates once again what an actor can do, given the right scenario and obviously a lot of freedom to give life to Julio. Diego Luna is also very credible in his portrayal of the son of a rich man on the road to discover himself. Obviously, the underlying theme is that both like each other, but it never comes out, as they both are so closeted and think themselves of being straight in such a macho atmosphere.Maribel Verdu plays the pivotal role of Luisa. She sees right through the boys, but has to play the part since they are the salvation from her miserable marriage. Here as in other Spanish films, she lets us know she is an actress who likes to take chances. This was the right vehicle for her and she takes advantage of a role that makes her outshine the rest of the cast.One can only hope more interesting things coming from this director and Mexico's gain is our loss, as it's obvious Mr. Cuaron's incursion into American films have not been as satisfactory as his work here.",

Sarju and Shabnam are in love but their love story end with such a tragedy that makes you think that socially acceptable and institutional ways of defining and allowing human relationship very often end up destroying the meaning of relationship itself.Set up of the movie is typical lower class Indian society. Najma and Salim are also in platonic relationship. Salim is a writer and a thinker while Najma is a beautiful and young woman from a withered Nawab family. Due to bad financial situation her mother is asking her to trade her body to feed the family. Najma, who doesn't accept that, runs away with another man (Akhter) to Bombay. But her mental situation is never still since she loves her family but is not ready to sacrifice her youth for them. Although is a good man and he is also interested in marrying her and but his middle aged boss wants Najma and Akhter to look for a bride for him. In order to save his job and apartment Akhter persuades Najma to do something that leads to destruction of Sarju and Shabnam's love story. Scenes from Hyderabad city in which poor parents are ready to do anything to get their daughter married are very impressive and well. All actors are very good, script, songs and costumes are fabulous. This movie was very advanced in its time of release. Even after 23 years since it release a large section of Indian society has not got the message of the movie. Western societies despite their own disadvantages are much much better systems in the perspective of this movie. Even today, girl child is seen as a burden in Indian society. Concept of single moms and even single parent is just not acceptable. Girls are identified either from the father's name or her husband's name. There is no third way. She doesn't have an identity on her own.Najma, in the end, after a discussion with Salim, realizes that she has to have her own identity which doesn't have to come from either Akhter (her potential husband) or her parents (who want to sell her body to live!). So, she say goodbye to Akhter and goes with Salim, perhaps to find her ways to wash off her part of sins she committed in order to gain identity from Akhter.A must see movie, If you want to understand worst part of Indian society and its solid institutional ways of doing things which are so fragile and delicate that they often get crushed.A bunch of 7 melodious songs will haunt you forever.",

    "review": "Fiza is definitely one of the better movies churned out by Bollywood in recent times. It carries a message that every religion is good but it is the politicians who are using religion as a weapon and destroying innocent families for ulterior motives. It deals with the problems being faced in India currently which have been repeatedly erupting and causing a huge dent in the economy. Since the past 50 years, every time India has got back on its feet a new politician created calamity has dragged it back down preventing it from being a power to reckon with and doing away with national problems like poverty and illiteracy which prevents people from leading a normal existence. And every time the roots of these calamities can be traced to religion. Everything is not fair in the name of religion. The film has good music and both Karisma & Hrithik have rendered superb award winning performances. Some people may feel that Hrithik's character is not very strong but looking at it from a perspective of what he is subjected to and circumstances which he cannot control make him the person portrayed in the movie. The silent scene of him in the train says it all.",

Nevertheless, I was impressed at the historical accuracy, the strength of the acting, and the vividness in the vision of the director.

Characters were a bit off (I still can't decide who was more over the top, Schindler or Goeth), fake sentimentalism was all over the place, . While it was a work of art and an important reminder of true events that shouldn't be forgotten, on emotional level it just somehow failed to deliver.Enter \"The Pianist\". With no Spielberg around to put his trademark sappy material, we finally have a movie that shows the true horror and tragedy of Jewish people in World War II. The story is told through the eyes of one man - Wladislaw Szpielman, Jewish pianist who works in a radio station in Warsaw during the German occupation of Poland. Together with him we watch his world getting torn apart, witness his family being taken away, his existence being reduced to bare essentials. Brody gives a subtle yet spectacular performance, his best work yet. And never once are we reminded that we are watching a movie. Everything is shown from Szpielman's point of view, and it is all very gritty and realistic. While Spielberg's rendition of German atrocities always had a slightly staged feel to augment their dramatic purpose, here they are so true to life there impact is much greater - you watch and are being reminded in horror that this things actually happened.While being very hard to watch sometimes, this is a movie that \"Schindler's List\" was supposed to be. This movie doesn't judge anybody, or tries to explain anything - it shows historical events as a reflection of one man's fate, making a powerful testimony that stays with you long after the beautiful last shot and the end credits are over.",

At times, they were so tedious that I was tempted to fast forward the DVD.  I was starting to feel that the director, writers, and producers were reluctant to approach a serious topic without infusing it with massive overdoses of nonsensical nonsense.  If not, then the only reason for the comedy was to pad the film to make it longer.  This is about the 3rd Indian movie that I have seen recently where the comedy sequences brought the primary story line to a screeching halt and seriously eroded the impact of the film on the viewer. I would have changed my vote from a 6 to an 8 had the comedy been deleted and the rest of the story fleshed out in greater detail.As for the rest of the story, I liked all the performances although Sonali Bendre was a little much at times.  I am also constantly amazed over how Anil Kapoor's character in this film and most of his movies is easily able to beat up one or two dozen bad guys without having any idea how he became so skilled.  He just does not fit the role of a Sunny Deol.The songs and locations were good although somewhat out of place but that is OK and significantly more palatable than feeble attempts at comedy.",

    "review": "This has a wonderful plot.  The father of grown daughters suffers the generational clash and cultural clash of old vs. new.  This is an hispanic (but English language)remake of the Chinese film \"Eat Drink, Man, Women\". Both show the writing credits of Ang Lee.  This falls far short of the original.I saw \"Eat, Drink...\" a few years ago. Although, my wife tends to dislike subtitled movies, she tolerated this one for me.  We both loved it.  It was well written, directed and acted.  \"Tortilla Soup\" is an ok movie, but failed to keep my attention in the same way that \"Eat, Drink...\" did.  The acting was OK.  The direction seemed ok as well.  I can't put my finger on why, exactly, but this movie just isn't as good.Unless you absolutely refuse to view subtitled movies, definitely forego this in favor of \"Eat, Drink, Man, Women\".",

    "review": "In her first suspense-thriller since her Academy-Award winning turn in \"The Silence of the Lambs\", Jodie Foster registers quite well as middle-aged New Yorker Meg Altman, who moves into an EXTREMELY spacious brownstone with her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart), a diabetic tomboy.  The building is equipped with a special shelter designed in the event of a break-in, known as a 'panic room'.  Meg and Sarah waste no time in putting the claustrophobic area to use (on their first night, no less) when a trio of burglars (Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam) make their way into her building to retrieve a large sum of money.  The catch is that the burglars' stash is in the very room in which Meg and her daughter are hiding!  While 'Panic Room' is not exactly white-knuckle suspense, it definitely has its moments, especially the heart-pounding moment when Meg leaves the panic room to grab her cell phone, and the the tension-building scene when Whitaker and Yoakam enter the panic room when Foster leaves.  The only main plot hole is clear in the very beginning: Why would a recently separated woman with one child want to purchase a four-story brownstone? What does she need all of that space for?  Besides that, 'Panic Room' is an intelligently written and directed thriller from director David Fincher (Fight Club).  The only characters that don't make sense are Meg's friend in the opening scenes and her husband (Ann Magnuson and Patrick Bauchau).  They both seem hopelessly unnecessary; otherwise, 'Panic Room' is a first-rate thriller with similarities to several shockers of the early 1990s, 'Unlawful Entry' (1992) being one in particular.  Whitaker has to be one of the nicest thieves in recent film history!",

In fact hes TOO cool - it seems that in any comic , cartoon or game hes involved with, he always comes out as the most interesting thing.It works the same way with the movie: seeing ghost rider in action provides almost all of the films entertainment value. Watching him ride down buildings , fight villains and flip the bird to the police is a cool sight to behold. When hes not on screen though ,things aren't that interesting. Nicholas cage is funny and quirky as johnny blaze and eva mendes is impossibly sexy (as per usual)but for the most part its all very cheesy and feels rushed and episodic.Also, the villains are frustratingly lame , including black heart who's severely downgraded from his comic book incarnation.When sitting through ghostrider , your best bet is to wait for the flaming skullhead to show up- watching him do his thing is tons of fun. Sadly the same cant be said about the rest of the movie.While its not bad it doesn't quite do ghostrider justice . Why ? Because hes TOO cool..........",

    "plot": "(at around 1h 5 mins) Ben Affleck and Matt Damon mention that one reason to do a film is because they owe the director a favor. It was writer and director Kevin Smith who brought the script of Will Hunting (1997) to the attention of producer Harvey Weinstein at Miramax.",
    "review": "Stoners Jay and Bob spend their time selling drugs in front of a grocery store and hanging out.  When they are introduced to the world of the internet they discover that a film version is being made of the comic book that they were the inspiration for.  Not only that but people are on the message boards insulting and slandering them.  In order to stop the slander Jay and Bob decide to travel to Hollywood to stop the filming and therefore stop the internet discussions.  A cross-country adventure ensues that includes stolen monkeys, international jewel thieves, the scooby-doo gang, a star wars confrontation, many many cameos and a million rude jokes.The plot for this film is very, very weak.  However for the most part you're laughing so hard you don't care how thin it is.  It's only the middle section where the Scooby Doo bit and the jewel thief bit come in, where the jokes are less funny and the plot is more silly where you feel it.  That said it's still really funny - Jay's desire to steal/liberate a monkey in order to get a woman to sleep with him is hilarious (\"we steal monkeys all the time in Jersey\" \"If I'd known stealing monkeys would get me sex, I'd have been doing it since I was 7!\") as is his rant on behalf of C.L.I.T.!The humour is all of one type.  If you know these characters from the other Red Bank films then you'll know if you'll like them or not.  If you don't know them already then some of the jokes here will go over your head - there's lots of in-jokes and references to actions and characters in the other films that you won't understand (although some are still funny).  Some of the references go too far and aren't funny - one joke in particular where the characters say something like \"who'd pay to see a movie like that?\" or \"I hate it when you get roped into a movie by a friend\" and then look out at the audience, isn't funny the first time or the 5th time.  However most of the jokes are really funny thanks to a) Mewes's wonderfully un-PC, obscene dealer and b) Smith's great writing.As I said some of the scenes are funny for 5 seconds but soon die out (the scooby doo bit gets dry pretty quick) but the majority is great.  Standout bits include the monkey stuff, the whole Miramax-ribbing climax, the Phantom Menace skit and Chris Rock's angry black director (very similar to Hooper in Chasing Amy).  The focus on sex related jokes makes for a film you're either going like or hate - and I loved it.  Yes too many characters from other film are shoved in unfunny scenes (Affleck's Holden is poor and Lee is given nothing to work with in the role of Brodie that he was fantastic in in Mallrats), but the majority of it is great.There are too many cameos to mention but nearly all of them are funny - high points include Chris Rock who missed out on making a black Sesame Street (he was going to call it N.W.P. - you work it out!), Carrie Fisher as the nun who lives by the book, Jason Biggs lamenting his pie-humping typecasting, Mark Hamill in the star wars spoof, the director and cast of Good Will Hunting poking major fun at Miramax and money grabbing sequels and Wes Craven directing Shannon Doherty in Scream 4 in a bang-on swipe at the Scream movies.  The main acting pressure was all on Mewes as Jay, as Bob doesn't speak enough to carry the film, and he succeeds.  Here his dirty mouth is given plenty of funny situations and good lines to work with and it ensures that his good performance carries through the whole thing and stops him getting annoying.Overall this is one funny film and a very good way to say goodbye to these characters.  Dry is some places, brilliant in others this isn't to everyone's taste but will please Smith fans easily.  It's not The Godfather but it does what it's supposed to and does it well.",

    "review": "At first I thought I was going to see a lightweight film from a great director but instead I watched another impressive achievement by Steven Spielberg. A few things stand out and of course the performances are terrific. Leonardo Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he's someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in \"A League of Their Own\" and his mere presence adds more to this film. The sign of a great film star. And Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances in his already interesting career. The last scene of him as he talks to his son in the restaurant is so moving that it reflects on the great talent of Walken. You can understand why Dicaprio admires and loves his father. Walken conveys these emotions and makes the audience react just accurately. I'll be rooting for him at Oscar time. Another impressive thing about this film is the beautiful cinematography by Janusz Kaminski who's a real artist with a camera and has worked on several Spielberg films. One shot in particular stands out. The ray of sunshine coming in through the kitchen window on Walken. Very thought provoking. And of course since its a Spielberg film its very personal. Spielberg was interested in the Frank Abagnale character because as a youngster he also came from a broken family and wanted to be someone else. Spielberg would sneak onto the studios and tell people that he worked there. Also, the real Frank Abagnale jr. appears as a French police officer. Well made, extremely well acted and sharply written. Viewers seem to forget that this is really a film about the breaking up of a family and the aftermath. This really is a personal film from Spielberg, and a very good one.",

    "plot": "Some of the radio chatter in the film was taken from actual radio transmissions made during the battle.",
    "review": "When you break it down and look at it both honestly and cynically (assuming that that is possible for a minute), there are really only two kinds of war movie: pro and con. The underlying theme of virtually every war movie - particularly since APOCALYPSE NOW - generally comes down to an analysis of the 'value' of war, of its worth. It's pointlessness, or its need. Is the action of battle warranted because of the attempt to find peace, or is war never justifiable, no matter what the intention?Pro or con?What is interesting is that since the Second World War, this underlying message that is found in nearly all war pictures has slowly changed from the former to the latter. This again is generally shaped in two ways. Either we see the play-by-play results following the issuance of what appears to be a bizarre and foolhardy set of orders from high command (i.e., APOCALYPSE NOW or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN). Or we get a glimpse of being right in the action as it all falls apart: hearing the bullets whizzing past our noses, reeling from the impact of RPG's and gazing blankly as the bodies begin to mount (PLATOON, say). BLACK HAWK DOWN, directed by Ridley Scott and accurately following the true story of the best-selling book by Mark Bowden, very much adopts the latter perspective.On October 3, 1993, a small unit of U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force troops were dropped by helicopter into hostile territory in Mogadishu, Somalia, with what is perceived to be a straightforward mission: the capture of two lieutenants of the Somali warlord, General Aidid. The unit is under command from Major William Garrison (Sam Shepard), and headed by Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett) in his first direct experience of frontline leadership. He also has a personal goal - to ensure everyone comes back alive.Yet, these things are never as easy as they appear - hence the development of the book and the film - and when 18-year old frontline rookie Todd Blackbird is injured early on, the entire mission begins to fall apart. More U.S. troops are injured, and when Somalis down two Black Hawk helicopters, the mission changes completely: it's now a rescue operation.And for about ninety minutes, you are subjected to some of the most intense, disturbing, graphic, violent and chilling pieces of conflict representation that you will ever see. Remember the Omaha Beach scene in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN? That was about half an hour long. Think of something three times that length, yet more 'realistic' and with (thankfully) no flag-waving. That is the gist of BLACK HAWK DOWN.Ultimately, one hundred-and-twenty-three U.S. troops were involved in the Mogadishu conflict. Nineteen were killed, and one thousand Somalis also perished.Unlike RYAN, BLACK HAWK DOWN doesn't build up a core group of characters, focusing on their emotional makeup and depth. No. Instead, we barely know our 'heroes', with very little time devoted to each characters motivation or purpose. And this is a good thing. At first, you find yourself a little bewildered by the sizeable cast, and this isn't helped by the many distant POV scenes that found this reviewer wondering just who he was seeing living and dying. But surely that is an important and crucial element of war - you're involved in these suicidal missions with men you barely know. You don't have time to share your life-stories. You may have only met that week, that day, or within the last hour. And then it's full on.We get snippets of character data: Eversmann's entire focus is on not letting the team down; Specialist Danny Grimes (Ewan McGregor), for so long tied to his desk simply because he excelled at typing; and Delta Sergeant 'Hoot' Hooten (Tom Sizemore, soon to be playing Bruce Banner in THE HULK), wise despite his years, somehow making more sense of the nonsense than anyone else.But any characterisation is underplayed and to the point, which is how it should be. The fresh-facedness and naivety of the troops is key to the success of the film, and of the emotional impact therein. As the errors and bodies mount, we get to see the horror of the conflict - the carnage and devastation, relentlessness and never-ending waves of Somali forces - directly through the eyes of the U.S. Rangers and Delta Force squad. I was somewhat stunned by the impact of the movie, both in the way the action grips you and shakes you violently until you want to let go, and in the occasional and very touching soft moments. Indeed, the action is so intense that I found myself at times glazing over, thinking of something else, and with hindsight I put this down to some kind of need for an emotional release; certainly, I cannot fault the film in that sense. It was simply a case of 'too much.'Throughout the movie both the acting and direction are superb; Ridley Scott has an eye for detail and filmography that is probably unmatched. Even his lesser efforts like HANNIBAL are beautifully shot. And BLACK HAWK DOWN is one of his best efforts to date.The musical score is also superb, and I was encouraged to hear the Stone Temple Pilot's CREEP near the beginning of the flick. I believe this is the first time I have heard a STP song in any movie.What is also very welcome is the lack of U.S. nationalism in this picture. Of America saving the day. Unlike, say, brother Tony Scott's TOP GUN - which yes, was making a different point entirely (i.e., let's make some money and recruit some boys to the Navy at the same time) - this isn't about the might of the U.S. There is no wake-leaving in BLACK HAWK DOWN. Real people made mistakes, and real people died.Speaking of Tony Scott, however, my only minor quibble was Sam Shepard's performance. He was probably in the wrong movie, as all his mannerisms (especially the way he took off his sunglasses in that quick-draw kind of way that stereotypical military types always seem to do) appeared to me to come straight out of TOP GUN. He was a little too 'bleh' for my tastes. For all I know William Garrison could have been exactly like that, but it still seemed a little Hollywood.I also wasn't completely comfortable as to how the Somalis were portrayed; this movie wasn't really about good versus bad in my opinion, but on the face of it the U.S. are the bad guys here. At least inasmuch as they were at fault. Comparisons are made with Vietnam both in the unnecessary involvement of the U.S. in the Somali civil war, and in the end credits of the film where we learn that the Medal of Honour was awarded to two U.S. soldiers for the first time since the Vietnam conflict. Yet, throughout the film the Somali are seen in only two ways - either a relentless force of bloodthirsty killers, or a simple people trying to stay out of the way. Now yes, this may be what it really was like - I cannot say because I wasn't there - but the overall message didn't fit well with me. They seemed too one-dimensional, a bit TOO bloodthirsty, and that left a bitter taste.Also as mentioned above the film is often confusing during the extended battle scene, and warrants more than one view. As the blood and dirt begins to pile, you will find yourself wondering who you are looking at, particularly when the perspective is on several soldiers from a distance. But that can be forgiven. This isn't PREDATOR, and while that film is outstanding as a piece of science fiction, it made a great effort to separate the marines so that the viewer would have an easy time following each one.That, of course, isn't real life, and BLACK HAWK DOWN is, perhaps, as close as we've come yet to an accurate capture of the true feel of war.Rating: **** 1/2 (out of five)",

At school, Jason learns that if he doesn't turn in an exam to his english teacher by five o'clock that night, then he will be in summer school. While riding his bike there, he is hit by a limo that is transporting Marty Wolff (Paul Giamatti), a nasty, rich, and lying movie producer. Jason gets a ride from him, and accidently leaves his english paper in the limo. When Jason goes to turn it in to his teacher, he realizes the paper is gone, and he tells his parents and teacher what happened- how he got hit by a limo transporting Marty Wolff--- but his parents don't believe him. Marty then steals Jason's story and puts \"Big Fat Liar\" into production. Now, along with his best friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes), he must get to Hollywood, track down Marty Wolff, and prove to his parents once and for all that he is not lying.

First off, the cast really blew me away, each and every actor did a great job with their respective roles. Uma Thurman is a terrific actress and she was definitely the right choice to play the lead character. Thurman commands this role and you are transfixed by her in every scene she's in. It's not just the action sequences that she is great in, she's just perfect for the role all around. And it wasn't just her that I loved, I also liked Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Lucy Lui. They all showed off their acting chops here, especially Fox, I personally loved her short time she's in the film. The writing is well done, I especially enjoyed Thurman's dialogue, the well written dialogue and the impressive way that she delivers that dialogue all comes together to make something great. I think most movie goers will enjoy this acclaimed movie, as long as they're not too conservative that is. I say that because the violence is truly graphic and very bloody, but in a strange way it kinda works for this one. I'm usually not a big fan of that, but here it works. Good job Tarantino! 8/10.",

My understanding is that Ford wanted to take on a role different than ones he had taken in the past to prevent type-casting, and while he does a good job in his role (as does just about everyone involved), the movie does slip up a little bit by having an almost nonexistent Russian presence in what is supposed to be the story of a Russian submarine.Comparisons to the far superior Hunt for Red October are inevitable, and it is interesting to note that that movie was also about a Russian submarine but was presented all in English, but it doesn't lose credibility the way K-19 does, probably because it at least maintained a Russian accent, while Ford is speaking an unmistakable American accent and Neeson, well, Neeson is just Neeson and that's always good. He makes a great German but is less convincing as a Russian. I don't know why.Nevertheless, as a story about an extremely important submarine mission rife with problems the movie succeeds brilliantly. K-19 is basically Russia's protection again nuclear war, which they fear the Americans might start at any moment. They hope to deter attack by showing evidence that they can issue destruction in return, and it is because of this that the sub is commissioned and sent on a mission to the polar ice caps to launch a test missile. There is a great scene where all of the crew and many other people are witnessing the launch of the submarine, and a woman swings a bottle of champagne on a rope to smash against the hull, but it bounces off unbroken. \"We're cursed,\" one of the dismayed crewmen says. That woman must have felt terrible.There is an immediate rivalry between Polenin, who understands the ship's limitations and wants them corrected before beginning the mission, and Vostrikov, who also understands the ship's limitations but also understands how important the mission is and so outranks Polenin's protests. One of the best things about the movie is that the dramatic action is pushed along by genuine concerns. The movie would have suffered terribly if they were ignoring such important problems with the submarine without good reason.One of the best things about the movie is that it is able to create so much dramatic tension, even though it takes place during peacetime. There was a huge amount of political tension in the air, but there wasn't a war going on. This is why there is not a lot of concern shown when an American destroyer is sighted near the submarine, because one of the goals of the mission is for the Americans to see what they're doing.Instead, a small leak aboard the nuclear sub becomes a problem big enough to potentially start a war. Incidentally, one of the crewmen noticed something wrong with one of the dials at least twice before the leak was discovered (once before the ship left port). Had he reported that problem when he first noticed it, he could have saved the lives of everyone who died because of the radiation and prevented the entire thing. At any rate, once the leak is discovered, the options are to abandon ship and surrender the crucial technology to the Americans (a single concession which could dramatically alter the futures of the two nations, and thus rendering it unacceptable), try to repair the reactor without sufficient protection against the radiation, or scuttle the ship (also unacceptable because of the boat's importance).There is a tense scene where Vostikov orders the ship to dive to almost crush depth, one of the obligatory scenes in submarine movies where the hull creaks and groans and everyone stares at the ceiling, like there's something to see there, and then he orders the ship to ascend at breakneck speed, surfacing through a layer of ice. Vostrikov intends to push the boat and the men to the limit so that they all know what the limit is, but unfortunately it culminates in a hugely disappointing display of digital effects as the ship breaks through the ice in something that looks more like it belongs in a cartoon than a serious film like this (I was reminded of the unfortunate Scrat's efforts to save an acorn from a splitting glacier in Ice Age).The film requires an extra bit of suspension of disbelief to accept a story about a Russian submarine but without any Russian actors. I'm curious to know how it was received in Russia. I imagine it was a hit, despite the lack of Russian presence in the film, because it illustrates their courage and dedication to their country in the most difficult of times. But nonetheless, it is hugely effective and never lets up once it gets going. The ending strikes me as the part where the most creative liberties were taken with the original true story, leaving you with the feeling of a Hollywood ending imposed on a true story from Russian and American history. But if nothing else, the movie is a fascinating look at how close we came to widespread destruction during one of the most tense times in modern history.",

The original is a good movie, and this doesn't really need to be it. Instead it takes a story, updates and tweaks it just a bit and creates a delightful world of it's own. Sure, there are a few plot holes, and yes, there are a few scenes that could have done better. But they aren't hell-worthy trespasses, and are forgivable for the sake of propelling the plot forward.Other than the spot on casting, which is enjoyable and fun and really well portrayed, what brings you into this film are the sets and sceneries. This movie came out before CGI was used to replace the world rather than augment the world, and so you have real sets in real woods and real costumed creatures, and it just pulls together nicely. The music fits incredibly well to capture the tribal setting that humanity has found itself back into without it being too anachronistic.All in all a fun, enjoyable film to watch, and much better than a lot of movies that have been coming out lately that force the narrative, rather than letting the story unfold.",

    "review": "If you're looking for a tear-jerking, emotion-provoking melodrama, this is your first on the list. I am Sam is a sensational dramatic piece that will leave you with tears to wipe. In the film, Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) is a mentally challenged single father who's left by, as what it seems, a one night stand homeless woman to raise his daughter Lucy(Dakota Fanning). Despite of being a mentally retarded person, Sam has a job working in a local Starbucks coffee store and has got friends with some what equal mental capacity. He's a sweet, good-natured, and loving father to Lucy that is equally attached to him.Unfortunately, a sordid twist of fate takes place in their paradise, at Lucy's 7th birthday a social worker believes that Sam, having the mental capacity of a 7-year-old, can't raise his child that is outgrowing him. Lucy is taken to a foster care temporarily as her father, along with the help of his mentally challenged friends, tries to find a high-profile attorney that can help him get his child back.After multiple attempts, Sam manages to appoint an attorney (Michelle Pfeiffer) who only takes the job at first as a dare. Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer) is a successful busy lawyer that comes home to a cheating man and a son who hates her, through the movie Sam and Rita develop a friendly relationship which is an eye-opening for Rita to value her family and be more involved in her son's life. Sam goes through a legal battle to retain custody of Lucy, aided by his mentally challenged friends, his agoraphobic neighbor Annie Cassell (Diana Wiest), and his high profile determined lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer).The film is enriched with major cast members that in turn give out one of their best performances in their career life. Most noticeably, Sean Penn who initially visited L.A. Goal, a center in Los Angeles for mentally handicapped persons as groundwork to his role. I was truly impressed with Sean Penn's performance on the set of I Am Sam and how well he managed his role and his dedication to it as he freely indulged in the character of Sam Dawson. For anyone who has Sean Penn as a favourite actor, it's a must watch as it is easily his one of many remarkable performance and the stepping stone of his career. As for Michelle Pfeiffer, I wouldn't expect any other actress to perform the role of Rita Harrison as beautifully good as Michelle did. It's a perfect fit to her character and she accurately embodied the character of Rita that possesses an exhausted ill-tempered work driven nature. Least but not last, the amazing Dakota Fanning did a remarkable role on the set, and by far one of her best performances as a child.The movie is Beatles-themed as we first understand Sam's character as an impressive Beatles-knowledgeable person despite being retarded. He then names his child Lucy Diamond inspired from the Beatles song \"Lucy in the Diamond Sky\". As a matter of fact, Michelle Pfeiffer's character is named after the song \"Lovely Rita\" by the Beatles and her surname is that of a Beatles member, George Harrison and if you noticed in the film, Rita Harrison(Michelle Pfeiffer) points that George Harrison was her favourite Beatle. In addition, the background music mainly consists of Beatles music and other Beatles songs covered by various artists for certain rights. The film is sweeping in its beauty, director Jessie Nelson did a great job in portraying her idea of \"I Am Sam\" into an absolutely wonderful movie especially after a 7 years of film directing drought. The cinematography is mostly hand-held work as the Camera is always close by to Sam for the obvious reason of picturing Sam's movement in a subjective sense allowing the viewer to actually feel with the character and pensively translate his actions. It's a closer look to the mentally handicapped people's world, that every act of their doing has an essence and that they are truly remarkable in their own \"special\" way.Lastly, should a intellectual deficiency restrain one from raising his own child? We've all had a grandma or grandma that despite of their intelligence in life aspects, had difficulty in helping their kids with their Geometry homework but does that alone hinder the child from having a well educated natural life? The movie has a great message, that when it comes to parenting, love is the most important thing and if that is present then it most certainly paves the way to a healthy parent-child relationship.",

    "review": "Nobody goes to see an Adam Sandler movie for spiritual enrichment or intellectual stimulation - let's get that out of the way first. Once you accept you've paid your money to be mildly entertained in a lighthearted, slapstick manner, strap in and enjoy the ride. I keep hearing Sandler is a major Hollywood player these days with an equal footing as producer as he is actor (he has produced a considerable amount with fellow actor Rob Schneider - the similarly inane but funny - mostly in spite of yourself - Hot Chick being the most recent example, in which he has a cameo role and indeed, Schneider helps Sandler out in Mr Deeds) so it's hard to prove that Sandler is now typecast as a lovable fool, because it's fairly likely he chose the part himself, possibly aware that Hamlet might be a little out of his league. Sandler need only check his bank balance to see that the lovable fool is certainly a lucrative one, having made an absolute mint playing countless other characters blessed with naive charm and a heart of gold. The story - we all know it's a remake of the classic depression-era propaganda film starring Gary Cooper, designed to lift spirits and foster a sense of community - centres around a picturesque New England town and its perenially-cheerful, smalltown inhabitants, chiefly Longfellow Deeds (Sandler), who inherits a fortune from an uncle he never knew, finds himself at the helm of a media empire and heads to the Big Apple to find out more. Here Winona Ryder steps in as the ambitious TV reporter determined to get her big scoop and dupes the affable Deeds into falling in love with her. All the time she's wearing a wire and a hidden camera to enable their courtship and his antics, sometimes drunken, sometimes heroic, to be broadcast on the evening news. Typically Deeds is the last to know and is appalled when he makes the connection. By which time Ryder's character has fallen in love herself, resigned from her job and is begging for a second chance. Deeds' only flaw is a short fuse and this is at odds with his generous spirit, who at times could be George Bailey, James Stewart's kindly smalltown character in Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1946), but this spices things up a little and allows the suspension of disbelief to continue a little longer. The number of disrespectful, foulmouthed city folk he takes out is entertaining, while not always convincing, but then times have changed and these days your average bloke doesn't think of taking a swing at a man for swearing in front of a lady (more's the pity I say). While you could aim criticism at this and jeer at the corny lines and simplistic moral at the film's end, there is something to be cherished here. The moral of course being that money is less important than being true to yourself, and while you're at it, be nice to your neighbour. As Mother Teresa once said, kindly words are heard once but their echoes are heard for ever - Deeds' character and his deeds (pun definitely intended) themselves are echoes of another, lamentably more innocent time and it's uplifting to see this spirit so laboured in the film's remake. It's also refreshing to see this bravely recreated by the producers, who have not shied away from dealing with the film's essence in these cynical times. It's not all sentimental Queen of Hearts stuff though. There are some hilarious, laugh-out-loud moments that counter the film's message perfectly - the helicopter ride to Manhattan where the crew and Deeds are singing 'A Space Oddity' complete with air-guitar springs to mind here - and there is the usual dose of slapstick you'd expect from a Sandler picture. The 7 flying cats rescued from a burning building by our hero is particularly memorable and as I say, I was laughing in spite of myself. This humour compliments the film's slushy message and prevents any actual retching in the theatre - leaving the cinemagoer shuffling out content, with a smile on his face - definitely a feelgood movie. I just hope Sandler doesn't attempt It's A Wonderful Life next, I don't think the world's quite ready yet.",

    "review": "In 1932, a group of socialites, landowners, Americans and their servants arrive at a country house for a shooting party over the weekend. As the relationships and tensions twist and weave upstairs, so too do the dynamics and relationships between the various house staff and valets below the stairs. Stories and characters play out but whenever a murder takes place, the police move in and everyone is a suspect.My plot summary suggests that this is a sort of murder mystery and that this will act as the driving force behind the narrative, however this is not the case and in reality the film is much more about the characters and relationships than it is about the murder. To this end the film will annoy some people who are perhaps not used to the sort of film that Altman produces and will be looking for the mystery aspect to be the all. However, I found the rather free-wheeling ensemble approach to be very enjoyable and the first hour moved quickly by thanks to the natural interactions and relationships and it was actually the mystery aspect that didn't work as well because it required too sudden a change in pace \u0096 a change that the material seemed to resist and hamper. Despite this it does still work mainly because the Oscar winning writing brings out such convincing relationships and social politics, making it enjoyable and interesting throughout. The direction is great; the use of two cameras in group scenes means that the actors seem to flow around as naturally as their dialogue would suggest \u0096 few seem forced to act to a fixed point and seem more realistic.Considering the talent on board, it is not surprising that nobody really upstages anyone in particular and the ensemble feel is strong. Smith, Gambon, Thomas, Dance, Northam, Balaban and others make the upstairs fizzle with snobbery and unspoken resentments. Meanwhile the downstairs staff are just as well drawn and delivered by Mirren, Owen, Jacobi, Watson, Bates, Grant, Atkins and others. Stephen Fry is fairly minor within the plot but he is delightfully comic, even if he doesn't quite fit into the film that well.Overall this is a classy film very much in the Altman style \u0096 an ensemble piece of characters and relationships that we are left to drift within. Some viewers will find it frustrating that it takes so long to get to the point where the mystery kicks in but I actually found this to be the weaker aspect of the film and the most enjoyable parts were the well written characters and dialogue, which deservedly won Fellowes his Oscar.",

    "review": "Some of the criticism this film has received seems a little unfair. While its concept, plot and characters are not very inventive, the tone of the film works.

The playing of an impressive cast is sound, with the supporting players, like Om Puri and Ben Miller making the most of limited parts. Stephen Dillane does a steady job as a smug, self-satisfied policeman baddie. I much enjoyed the absurd bit where he laughs maniacally for a while while on TV and the camera zooms into the TV screen Coogan is watching him on. Newcomer Emma Williams is an effective addition to the cast, although she doesn't have all that much to do in plot terms, come to think of it. The finely named Lena Headey is very inoffensive as the \"love interest\", and thankfully the romance such as it is is light-hearted and made part of the convoluted plot. Perhaps a problem is the excess of characters, a few of whom could be done without. Omar Sharif's cameo was briskly enjoyable, but hardly necessary to the plot, for example. Steve Coogan, so successful on TV with the Alan Partridge character, goes for a more likable, less intricate comic character in this film. He is often excellent, in scenes such as when he does an odd, buffoonish dance in a club. There are plenty of effective little character touches and importantly, one is made to like his character and want him and his \"gang\" to win out, so to speak, by the end. A film reminiscent of past British Ealing comedies, yet with a fair dose of crudity. In the context of today, this is an impressively funny film, but it does not quite match up to \"The Ladykillers\" or \"The League of Gentlemen\", for example. It is slightly overlong, but largely a winning, refreshing minor comedy.",

Shararat is a different from the league film which will surprise you with nice story, good direction, good acting and tight screenplay. This is the movie that will entertain you and your family . Abhishek Bachchan and Amrish Puri did a remarkable job, one as a spoilt brat and the other as the one who brings Abhishek back to right path. Hrishitaa is good too. Casting director did a good job. Each and every actor play their part to perfection. Mohnish Behl did a good job as the evil advocate. Ashish Vidyarthi is ok with his cameo appearance. Romesh Sharma and Navni Parihar as Dad and Mom of Abhishek Bachchan are noticeable . All the credit goes to debutant director Gurdev Bhalla for making a nice family entertainer which you will cherish with your family, with elders and children .",

Colin Firth is a very good as the father. Kelly Preston has very little to do and it's a shame. Eileen Atkins, as the would be grandmother doesn't fare better, as it's the case with Jonathan Pryce.I recently caught up with it on DVD format and all that can be said is that it was mildly amusing as a typical comedy of this genre.",

    "plot": "Final film of Dilip Kumar.",
    "review": "Acting legend, Dilip Kumar has been bestowed upon with the title of Tragedy King in bollywood (though he had done hilarious comedy too in Ram and Shyam, Gopi etc.). However never had I seen him in a murder mystery and that too with himself doing the investigation of the murder, prior to Qila which is the last released movie of his acting career. Quite interestingly, Dilip Kumar is not only the investigator but also the murdered one as well, doing double role in this movie. In this way, the characters played by Dilip Kumar in his last movie, are quite different from the ones he played throughout his career.Qila was released in April 1998. After appearing in my viva of the Indian Civil Services Exam at the UPSC in the morning hours, I went to watch the matin\u00e9e show of Qila at Plaza theater in Connaught Place, New Delhi with my wife and my dear friend Aqueel Ahmed on 29th April, 1998. Since the movie was a murder mystery, myself, like always, started guessing about the murderer and discussing with my wife and friend in the interval. However, my guesses did not come true. Somebody else came out as the murderer in the climax and not the one whom I was suspecting to be.Qila starts with a murder committed by Gulshan Grover. However an innocent man is arrested for it and put under trial in the court. The judge, Amar Nath Singh (Dilip Kumar) feels that the convict is innocent but there is nobody to support him. Being a man of justice, he himself decides to investigate the case and find out the truth. However, his task increases when his own twin brother, Jagannath Singh (Dilip Kumar 's second role) is found murdered in his fort (Qila). Jagannath Singh was a corrupt landlord with very low morals and mean mentality because of which Amar Nath Singh had distanced from him. However, he feels that finding out the murderer of his brother is his duty. So he starts digging his past which is full of skeletons. Coming to know of the injustice and wrongdoings of his brother with many people (especially women), judge Amar Nath Singh, along with his murder investigation exercise, takes corrective steps on behalf of his deceased brother to do justice to the victims. However all of them are in his list of murder suspects. The real murderer comes before him in the ending scene only.Qila contains a very good murder plot full of potential. However director Umesh Mehra faltered in developing it into an outstanding murder mystery which he could have done just by exercising some creativity and careful handling of the script. Perhaps he got too overwhelmed with Dilip Kumar's personality and overlooked certain leads which, if developed properly, could have made this mystery more engrossing and satisfying in the end with revelation of a different character as the murderer.All the same, Qila is a good watch since the suspense is well-maintained. The background of the murder and the hidden facts are revealed to the audience on layer-by-layer basis. Dilip Kumar's briskness and energy at the age of 76 years surprises the viewers. His dance in the song - Kurte ki baiyaan ko upar chadhai ke looks amazing at this age. He is all-pervasive in the movie and gets the maximum possible footage. His towering performance has been ably supported by Mukul Dev who plays the unrecognized son of Jagannath Singh (why the director has named himself too as Amar is not understandable to me as two main characters of the movie having the same name, creates confusion only). The movie contains characters like Rekha, Malay Chakraborty, Mamta Kulkarni, Smita Jaykar etc. However these are all dwarfed before the tall persona of Dilip Kumar. Other than Mukul Dev, if somebody makes her presence felt in the movie, it is Rajeshwari Sachdev who plays the daughter of judge Amar Nath Singh.The music given by Anand Raj Anand is quite good. Technical and production value aspects of the movie are more or less OK. The scenes between the brother Mukul Dev and the sister Rajeshwari Sachdev are quite impressive. The director has rendered a logical end to the story after the mystery is resolved.Qila is a good murder mystery which could have been a much better one. However it is an interesting watch. All the mystery fans as well as the fans of Dilip Kumar will like it.",

Nobody said you had to watch the dang show for cryin' out freakin' loud!  If you don't like the show fine.  Simple answer . . . DON'T WATCH IT!!  Easy enough??  Granted almost all the monsters are cheesy (it's a KID'S show for cryin' out loud!) but no one is forcing you to watch it are they?  No one is twisting your arm and tying you to a chair are they?? Now then, now that I've said my peace.  Personally, I like all the shows, some more than others, but . . . (like Lightspeed Rescue, Time Force, and Wild Force).  I'm not too keen on changing casts every year, but it keeps it interesting.  I was slightly disappointed in the \"Forever Red\" episode, but the fight scenes more than made up for it.  I don't know if Saban ever checks these comments, but, in case he does, Release a longer version of that episode to video, PLEASE!!!  Preferably one that explains it a little more.  To all the guys and gals that don't like the shows consider this . .. ALL of the Power Ranger shows are adapted from Japanese Sentai.  The only way to stop Saban from making Power Rangers is to stop the Sentai, which is going to be impossible because it is so popular out there.  Also, in regards to Sentai, which I would like to see some if it ever gets subtitled and released in America, consider that it has been running (with the 5-hero format) FOR 25+ YEARS!!  THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY THE MONSTERS ARE SO CHEESY.  I don't mean to diss Sentai (like I said, I would like to see some), but think about it for a second people!  If Saban does read these comments, DON'T EVER STOP making the shows!!!  I'm looking forward to the 11th (can we count that high???) season of Power Rangers entitled Power Ranger Ninja Storm. 11 seasons!!  THINK ABOUT IT PEOPLE!!!

    "plot": "Filming of a death penalty protest scene at the Texas State Capitol was briefly disrupted by the arrival of a group of real political protesters.",
    "review": "The Life of David Gale (2003)Whether you are pro or anti death penalty, there's not getting past the sensational, brave, and maybe insane elements of this story. Based on fact about a death row inmate who had been famous as a death row protester, the core of the movie is how a young reporter (a convincing Kate Winslet) interviews the inmate (an equally convincing Kevin Spacey) in the days before his scheduled execution. We are gradually shown the backstory through their interviews, and another story builds as the reporter chases down new leads, including missing video evidence. Laura Linney plays an important third lead that starts to throw doubts into everyone's mind, including the audience's.All of this sounds like a great movie should have come out of it: superb casting and acting, a great story with believable but astounding twists, and a nice tight framework, day by day, with methodical flashbacks. Instead the movie both tries too hard and fumbles some of the key moments. What is clearly dramatic is sometimes made over-dramatic (Winslet running and running and running, or words like \"innocent\" spinning across the screen between scenes). Other sensationalist add-ons make the movie cheap (seeing a chaingang neatly working along the road just as they drive by). And simple reactions aren't believable (they way characters respond to someone following them, or to other threats). This is important stuff for a movie trying to recreate the truth. By my guess, the director is the key suspect, though he has a raft of successful films behind him, including the closest echo, Midnight Express (1978), which is about injustice and a prisoner who is extraordinary. But in all his films (that I've seen, which is quite a few, it turns out), there is a feeling of powerful story line carrying the day (Mississippi Burning, Birdy). Parker has also made a series of films tied to contemporary music, from Evita which is fair to The Commitments which is terrific fun, as well as The Wall, which might be his best film in all, though a difficult one. All of these films have a great setting, either musically or geographically.Here we have only the dull backdrop of conservative Texas (if that's not redundant). And a blazing, heartwrenching story. Which is fair enough as a start. The Life of David Gale is a powerful morality tale, most of all, with some great acting, and many or most people watching will be glad they saw it. All those little flaws fade further and further as you get toward the end.And then the end, the famous big final twist. That's memorable stuff. Wow.",

Jackie is an amazing man, with the stunts he can do at his age.Meanwhile, Jennifer Love Hewitt is easy on the eyes, especially showing us her body, but her character in here is pretty lame.

The three lead actors are gorgeous - so it hardly matters that they must be the oldest students in town. The cinematography is beautiful - especially in the Australian sequences. The song and dance routines are as welcome as they are surprising.As with all Hindi films, it is pure melodrama of course. The ability to suspend one's disbelief is a necessity. But that aside, it has all the attributes of a good old fashioned Hollywood romance. Boy meets girl, boy loses girl... etc., times three.The core theme of friendship is a delight - as are the subtle homo-erotic overtones of Akash and Sid's relationship. Intended or not, I wouldn't have minded if they'd ended up together - but this is Bollywood remember!All in all, fantastic fun which I plan to watch again and again. Highly recommended.",

Joel Schummacher's direction is very good in this film, it is hard to believe that this is the same director who directed the disastrous Batman and Robin. The music is just wonderful, with dark and poignant melodies and motifs that fit the very dark story, not to mention sad. People have complained that the film has too much music, almost all of it is sung, but it is a musical, set in an opera house bear in mind. The performances are excellent, Gerard Butler quite terrifying as Phantom, and Emmy Rosum as beautiful as ever as Christine. I liked the performances of Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richardson and Minnie Driver(as Carlotta). The film does have some truly sad moments, like Christine at the grave yard and of course the heart-rending ending, though I didn't understand it when I first saw it. My only complaints are that the film is a little too long, and also in Angel of Music particularly, there were times when the lips of the actors weren't in time with the singing. Apart from these flaws, a truly beautiful film, one that is dark and sad, and one that is once seen never-forgotten. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",

    "review": "`Austin Powers in Goldmember' provides us with an hour and a half of inspired silliness.  Not all of the film's elements work equally well, of course \u0096 a seemingly common occurrence in even the best of comedies \u0096 but this third in the series of popular spy spoofs generates more laughs than almost any other movie released in 2002.  Prime credit goes, of course, to Mike Myers, who both co-wrote the screenplay and inhabits no fewer than four of the movie's main characters. By this time, Myers has become so adept at his characterizations that watching him at work and at play here provides one of the prime pleasures of our viewing experience.  Also in attendance are the usual suspects:  Verne Troyer as Mini-Me, Michael York as Basil, Robert Wagner as Number 2, Seth Green as Scottie and Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissinia.  Folks added to the brew this time around include Fred Savage, Michael Caine and Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra, a bad-ass soul sister brought back from 1975 \u0096 Afro hairdo and all - to help Austin rescue his kidnapped father and prevent Dr. Evil from yet again trying to destroy the world (this time by using a giant meteorite to melt the polar ice caps and flood the earth).Co-written by Michael McCullers and directed by Jay Roach, the film has the good sense to throw caution to the wind and give Myers free rein to indulge himself in his own brand of inspired lunacy.  The film starts off with a deliriously clever and funny opening credit scene in which many of Hollywood's biggest names make surprise, good-natured cameo appearances. That sense of unbridled fun carries through pretty much the entire film, although there are, as to be expected, ideas, bits and jokes that seem less effective than others.  As with the two previous films, this `Austin Powers' suffers from the unfortunate tendency to both repeat and explain too many of its jokes.  Sometimes you do find yourself wishing that the writers would put a bit more faith in the audience to get the humor the first time around. Still, there seems to be much less of that in this particular episode, and there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to more than compensate for the occasional \u0096 though not all that frequent \u0096 clunker or lull that manages to sneak its way in there from time to time. `Austin Powers in Goldmember' wallows a bit overmuch in the sordid moments, the gross-out gags, the locker room and bathroom humor that have become, alas, the hallmarks of the modern comedy.  In short, this is probably not the film to take the family to see if your family includes impressionable children and/or easily offended adults.  The sexual and scatological meters run into the red zone rather often in this film.  Nevertheless, `Austin Powers in Goldmember' works well if you enjoy a comedy where the actors seem for once to have been actually having a fun time while making it.   Their infectious joy spills off the screen in a way that it doesn't in movies like `Mr. Deeds,' `Men in Black II' or, perish the thought, `The Master of Disguise,' to name just a few of the comedic bombs that have been foisted upon the unsuspecting public this summer.  In contrast to the makers of those films, Mike Myers knows how to deliver the goods and, in the process, give his fans their hard-earned money's worth. Reserve us a seat for the next installment.",

What really makes it wonderful is the incredible performances and suspense. I really love all the actors' and actresses' dedication and believability, there being very memorable deliverances of lines and scenes after the film is over. The suspense is top-notch, because of how well the movie is played out and how creepy and fun the material is, that I was both eyes on the screen every second. Naomi Watts is radiant and brilliant; the scenes where she slowly puts the pieces of the puzzle together, or uncovers something dark and haunting are haunting themself because of how marvelous she makes this material.Do not get me wrong, the material itself is great, but it would have been nothing were it not for the cast. The characters are all interesting, and the main story is quite saddening and effective when it is slowly revealed through many different aspects. While it seems as though the main threat, a \"killer videotape\", would be a ridiculous and stupid threat, hard to make convincing, it undoubtedly works to the fullest here and is entirely convincing, the videotape's images and the events themselves all being very interesting and entertaining. While the movie is not a masterpiece, it is not too short from it, having a great replay value and being one of the top 20 most effective horrors of the 00s, in my opinion. I am glad it receives a lot of positive reception, for it deserves every bit of it.",

It is true that all the victims are females. Yet, the killings are connected with the reproductive capacity of the females that the males do not possess and can not control. A main motive is the pregnant women's ability to kill their (male) foetuses. The most influential male character, Shin Hyun, murderer now in a prison, has a non sexual foetus like aura. The killings are carried out as revenge on the women for this ability, obviously and totally in vain. Thus, the film describes a core dilemma true for all males. However, I am not aware of a comparable open description in European literature of film. Yet, I have seen it in Japanese films (e.g. Shindo's Onibaba). \u0096 A most interesting film.",

    "review": "Another film about a progressive teacher trying to teach her students how to think outside of the box. Fortunately, unlike School of Rock, my views on which were accosted last week, I left Mona Lisa Smile mostly satisfied with what I had seen. No, it's not especially revelatory or surprising. You can more or less guess what's going to happen to each character by the end. But it does leave a little more room for characterization, for slightly unexpected outcomes, and it doesn't telegraph its moments quite so rigidly as the Linklater film. Julia Roberts is an actress about whom I feel nothing; I neither like nor dislike her. I think this is one of her better performances, certainly much better than her Oscar winning role in Erin Brockovich. She plays the progressive art history teacher, who arrives at Welsley to learn that all of her students have already studied the textbook from cover to cover, and can answer any question that might arise from the class's current syllabus. The curriculum and Roberts' superiors are strict in what they want to teach about art, but Roberts veers towards teaching what the textbook will not despite them. The superiors are unhappy with her course, but some of the students are opened up to the experience. Outside of class, Roberts faces as large a challenge. Most of her students have completely resigned to the idea that they are destined for marriage and nothing more. The status quo must be challenged. The students are a nice range of characters. Kirsten Dunst plays the most conservative, who is about to be married when the film opens. She, of course, rejects Roberts' ideals. On the other end of the spectrum is Maggie Gyllenhaal, who is the sexually promiscuous girl who idealizes her teacher. Slightly left of center is Ginnifer Goodwin and right of center Julia Stiles. These four characters are set up very mechanically, of course, but the characters succeed (and this can be said about all of the other characters of the movie, including Roberts', who are all rather mechanical) on the quality of acting. Each of the performers are wonderful. They manage to make you care, which is something that didn't happen with School of Rock, whose performers (with the one exception of Joan Cusack) were adequate or worse. I especially loved Marcia Gay Harden, giving another one of the best performances of 2003, as Roberts' roommate, who teaches etiquette. She's a pathetic, tragicomic image of what some of the girls will become if they insist that the traditional concept of womanhood remain unchanged. The film also boasts exceptional technical qualities. It's simply very well made. 8/10.",

What lets Anger Management though are one or two scenes that don't quite work such as the basketball scene and a final third that is not only a little draggy compared to the first two-thirds but rather clich\u00e9d and cheesy too.

    "review": "The plot line of this Power Ranger series is very good.  Ninja Schools from all over the world have been destroyed by a former ninja student named Lothor who after being cast off the planet for turning to evil.  Lothor has kidnapped ninja students from all over the world and has turned his former sensei literary into a Guinea Pig.  The only hope that the sensei Guinea Pig and his son Cam have are three slacker students of their own ninja school. They now have now have the powers of the Wind Power Rangers and their true potential is now put to the test for they hold the fate of the world in their hands.This series is somewhat of a take off of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  I say cause of the personalities of the Wind Rangers and that their mentor who is an animal and looks cartoonish but the personality is very wise (not to mention the Rangers mistake him for a rat in the first episode).  PR Ninja Storm also mirrors the original Mighty Morpin series in several ways.\nFirst the Wind Rangers must shout out a command in order to morph.  In MMPR the Rangers called out the name of their Dinosaur or prehistoric animal to change into Ranger form.  Here they must shout out \"Ninja Storm Ranger Form\" in order to morph.  Other Power Ranger series had a shout out before the Rangers morphed, but it was window dressing sort of speak.  \"MMPR had a mentor who was bound in a cylinder (Zordon) and a robotic helper (Alpha 5). Ninja storm has a mentor who is bound by an animal form but helped by his son who is a techno wiz so you have the same concept but done differently. Alpha 5 was skeptical at times of the Rangers but Zordon had faith.  Cam is the same way but his dad believes in the Wind Rangers, and he might have expelled them from his school had this crisis not come up.  So far only two episodes have aired and the rival Thunder Rangers are suppose to show up in episode 3.With the way Power Rangers follows the Super Sentai counterpart by changing it every year, expect development of all the characters and maybe some key revelations about some of them incorporated into the storyline.  Allready Grant McFarland is pulling a dual role of the voice the senei GP and Lothor. Could it be that they are related?  Hopful their will be a all compsing storyline and a great climax at the end of this PR series.  It shows some promice.",

    "review": "As a person who can speak from a reputable stand point, I have to say this movie is different than many other \"war\" movies and is generally regarded highly among many different types of members in the U.S. military. This films representation brought forth a perspective that showed a few sides to a mission. Yes there is the desire to finish and get out. But the film also showed that the situation can change on the ground as it always does, and sometimes you have to modify. An seasoned veteran like Lt. Waters who is somewhat seasoned being a Lt. probably would have the foresight to say it is safe to go ahead and try and get these people to a border being that was the only way to drag the doc outta there without hog tying her, even though the orders above were different. A team leader is expected to use some discretion and Lt. did that. Although it was borderline crazy operationally it still worked. Working in that environment is not just like a round of socom. Things happen and you have to do the best you can for the situation if it is feasible and you have the balls to do it. Also, the depiction of the action scenes were practically dead on and impressive. Mr. Fuqua didn't cheese it up, it was kept fairly raw and confusing as is a real engagement. The ethnic cleansing scenes, well it doesn't get any more realistic than that. I can understand why everyone else hates America for doing these films about ourselves but honestly can you see a french film showing specwar going into save a village, nope. They would hand out white flags to everyone. Maybe the Aussies, Israelis, or Brits, but pretty much beyond those three countries thats all ya got. If at the least, this is a reminder that even when you think you know about what our guys are doing in the world, you don't know the half,we lose guys everyday and people should realize that a silent war exists.",

    "review": "An inner city neighborhood trial and tribulations put to film of a poor Latino family in New York would seem to be nothing more than a setup for hard ship and perhaps gang violence.  However, the beauty of a film like Raising Victor Vargas is it can stick with a simple story of a young mans attempt at coming of age while sidestepping the usual affairs that such an environment is not conducive or even believable to a childhood romance.We first meet Victor in the room of some young girls apartment.  It soon becomes apparent that Victor's reasoning for being in this room is to loose his virginity simply for the fact that when he brags to his friends that he's not a virgin he can finally be telling the truth for once.  As a 16 year old this important in the macho culture that pre-dominates around his neighborhood.It soon comes apparent though, that Victor won't have sex with this young girl, and more importantly Victor discovers a poolside young beauty named Judy that he would like to charm.  However, it's up to Victor to prove himself capable of being a decent man as Judy has to endure constant harassment and has given up on the idea of men in general.Some other relationships develop between some of the other younger kids around the neighborhood and they all feel distinctly genuine.  But it's Victor's ability to try to learn how to treat people right while respecting his Dominican grandmother that become the center and highlight of the film. Victor (played by Victor Rasuk) embodies a youthful charm in this film that is so natural and can't be faked.  The grandmother (played by Altagracia Guzman) is amazing as the old fashioned family protectorate who has to keep everyone in line.  Your heart just aches for this old woman who sees in Victor perhaps her own previous husband and fears only the worst. \nPeter Sollet has really worked a gem of a film showing these kids as without much but truly blessed with the gift of caring and that's what makes the film so unique.  There's even a great scene where the grandma takes Victor to social services simply to say \u0091I have had enough of him, he's trouble, he's a bad influence' and that she just can't take it anymore with his antics.  In the end the social worker just tells her to go home and stop complaining.  Any other film would instead make it an overdramatic tug of war.Without spoiling anything, the courting of Judy ends in a way that for the most part works in the context that Victor and the other characters inhabit. It's a wonderful tale of youthful love in a setting that probably happens more often than you think.Rating 8 out of 10",

    "review": "The film, directed by Fernando Meirelles, tells the story of life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, in an area known as the Cidade De Deus, the City of God.  The story is told from the narration of the young photographer, Rocket.  The different scenarios of life that make up the wider-story are presented in Pulp Fiction style chapters, complete with on-screen titles for each different story component.  The story covers all the facets of the life, charting the growth of several key members of the gangs from childhood through to young adulthood, with their transformation from young hoodlums to local drugs barons.  The final parts of the story focus on the battle within the Cidade De Deus between two different groups, when business and personal matters lead to an unavoidable confrontation.  And what a confrontation it is, although details will not be given away here.  The result is a powerful telling of life based around real-life events.Martin Scorsese seems to have a heavy influence on the direction of this picture, with many moments looking familiar to fans of the legendary American filmmaker.  Close ups, sweeping scene shots, freeze-and-zoom shots, and a frenzied handheld approach are all trademarks that will be recognisably traceable to Scorsese, having been used throughout his career. Many shots remind the viewer of Scorsese's narrative dialogue-camera relationship in Goodfellas, in which the camera was used to brilliant effect to highlight the main points in the script.  This technique is used heavily in the first twenty minutes of Cidade De Deus, with the freeze frame trick being used to introduce the story's main characters alongside the dialogue of narrator, Rocket.Throughout the film one cannot help but watch a scene and think, 'I've seen that in Raging Bull, Goodfellas, or Casino', and this may make some look less favourably on the film's direction.  However, it is not fair to consider this 'a Brazilian Goodfellas', as one critic has observed.  The story has parallels - the underlying ideas of gangsters, drugs and violence -, the direction is similar, and the story is told with narration, much like Ray Liotta's role in Scorsese's epic.  But to regard this film in terms of what styles it repeats or nods it's hat to, is to be very ignorant. Fernando Meirelles,  has done a wonderfully hypnotic job of blending the old styles, and bringing them up to date with flashy and sometimes dangerously kinetic direction and editing.  Look only to the leaving-party scene in which strobe lighting is used to extraordinary effect, almost suffocating the story below a bombardment on the visual senses.  Think of a crossover between the visual energy of the Matrix and the violence of the club scene in Bad Boys.Cidade De Deus is much more than a directorial assault on the senses.  As Raul Walsh said if you don't have a story you have nothing, and many flashy Hollywood films have fallen short in using 'ultra-modern' direction to disguise the fact that no substantial story exists underneath.  Cidade De Deus is most brilliant in that it combines directorial and editorial brilliance with a story that is almost second to none in recent times. Only the true greats manage to cater to these two needs of cinema, and this is one that does.  The direction is amazing, but not to disguise the story flaws, and the story is brilliant, but does not overwhelm directorial originality.  But simply, Cidade De Deus is a perfect film for avid fans of cinematography, and those just in search of two hours of a bloody good story.I cannot decide yet if I would consider this better than Amores Perros, but it is certainly not inferior.  The at-the-same-time stylish and brutal visuals of Amores Perros are replaced by a grittier, more hands on approach to the subject.  Whilst in Amores Perros the characters took precedent, in Cidade De Deus the location is as big a character as those who live there. As a result we get a much greater feeling of the environment in which the characters exist, and so it is perhaps easier to empathise, and/or sympathise with them.  As the official press synopsis says, Cidade De Deus is a character, but is a place not a person.  Amores Perros triumphs in creating relationships between the audience and the characters, as it concentrates for a long time on relatively few people, each of whom we grow to know and ultimately care about, which is important for the emotional impact of the film.  Cidade De Deus deals with dozens, even hundreds, of characters, and so it is only a minority that we become attached to.  This means that while the film leaves a lasting impact we are not left with the same inquisitiveness about the future for the characters that we meet in Amores Perros.  Both films leave open ends, but Cidade De Deus feels closed. Whether you consider this a good or bad thing is a matter for personal choice.Cidade De Deus is essential viewing, and is cinema at its most brilliant. It will of course feel the wrath of critics who will dwell on the almost unimaginably high body count, but there are always those who will reject violence in the movies.  In fact the violence in Cidade De Deus, even the apocalyptic ending, is not as raw and bloody as many will expect.  Blood spilling is a rare sight, and the violence rests mostly, but not always, on choreography rather than in your face bloodshed.  The result is violence, but it is often so artistic that it looks beautiful rather than deterring. Like Scorsese's Taxi Driver the violence is abhorrent, but admirable from a cinematic perspective.In short, this is a superb achievement, and is easily one of the best films of the year, and of the decade so far.  Like it's predecessors, this is the latest film to come out of South America that indicates the emergence of major new talent in filmmaking.  Hollywood beware.",

    "review": "Y'know, it's kind of sad to see some of the comments bemoaning Eddie Murphy for not swearing enough anymore. It's almost as if some people equate foul language with humour. If you're one of those people who thinks a comic sketch is much funnier with swearing in it, then you'll no doubt not like Eddie in this movie.On the whole, I found DDC to be harmless, unpretentious entertainment aimed at kids, naturally, but with sufficient adult-only gags thrown in to keep the parents happy. In short, a formulaic kids movie designed to keep parents from being bored and kids amused.The plot is silly, and predictable, but you don't go to these sorts of films looking for deep and meaningful dialogue or witty social commentary. You just go to be entertained. And DDC does deliver on that score.\nOf particular amusement is Steve Zahn, as the rather cliched Star Trek geek who is the only one who can speak to one of kids - in Klingon! He does kind of steal a lot of the scenes in which he's in. Anjelica Huston is starting to look real old, but still has that menacing screen presence that no doubt helped land her the role of Mrs Harridan (yep, that really is her name) in this picture. I'm thinking she would have made a much better Cruella de Ville than Glen Close's overacting scenery munching version in 101 Dalmations.The only thing I found a little irritating about this movie was the number of times a microphone popped into view at the top of the screen. I must have counted at least five instances. I kind of grew used to this in the 80's straight-to-video days, but you don't really expect to see it nowadays, so it was a little annoying.Other than that, the movie is harmless and fun. And for those that complain about Eddie not swearing enough....this is a KIDS film, you know.",

    "review": "Santoshi's 'The Legend of Bhagat Singh' tells a detailed biography of the martyred hero. He does provide both the good side and the dark side (his obsession blinding him to the fact that it's wrong to teach children to make bombs). Santoshi also shows the clash between Bhagat Singh's and Gandhi's viewpoints quite effectively. He has tried to stay historically accurate and even though it was released during the same time as Guddu Dhanoa's snoozefest '1930 Shaheed', 'The Legend of Bhagat Singh' triumphs above that and is a masterpiece in comparison.Ajay Devgan, though intense roles are his strength, may seem like an odd choice to play the title role, especially because there is no physical resemblance and he is too old for the part. Otherwise, he delivers a winning performance. Sushant Singh and Akhilendra Mishra are equally powerful. The supporting cast that includes an excellent Raj Babbar, a sincere Farida Jalal and dusky beauty Amrita Rao leave a mark. I liked the actress that played Durga who seems to be an important female figure in Indian history. I would like to see a movie about this woman. The actors who play the Brits are horrendous.The cinematography is fine and A.R. Rahman's soundtrack is another winner. Most of the songs are patriotic but there are a few different numbers too. The background score, though beautiful, is intrusive at times and kind of adds a melodramatic feel (when that isn't necessary).'The Legend of Bhagat Singh' is one of the fewer biopics in Indian cinema that tells a good story while attempting to stay true to the facts. Some might find it difficult to watch due to the violent content but it is a movie that is worth viewing.",

'Underworld' is an action-packed, visually stunning spectacle!As mentioned in my 'Underworld: Rise of the Lycans' review, it is best to view 'Rise' first, and then 'Underworld' - although 'Underworld' was the first film in the series. It makes more sense, since you will now have a much better background on Lucian. Lucian is the leader of the werewolves, and the antagonist (he was the protagonist in 'Rise of the Lycans').Centuries after Lucian became the Werewolf (Lycan) leader, the feud between vampires and werewolves still rages on. Lucian is trying to join vampire and werewolf blood to create a super species, but he needs the blood of a human, Michael Corvino, who is the direct descendent of the vampire/werewolf ancestor.'Underworld' features excellent performances from a very good cast - especially Bill Nighy as Viktor, and Kate Beckinsale as Selene. The make-up and visual effects are fantastic. There's loads of action, and incredible chase sequences, with stunning photography. This truly is a perfectly polished production. There never really is a dull moment - considering the film runs 132 minutes (I watched the extended version).This is non-stop action and entertainment from beginning to end. There's also more than enough suspense and horror for the horror buffs. 'Underworld' is an incredible action horror like no other. And the ending leaves you hungry for more!",

    "review": "Farhan Akthar has to live upto his debut 'Dil Chahta Hain' - a feat which will be difficult to match. FA will carry the DCH label forever, much like Ramesh Sippy was labeled with the Sholay tag. Comparing Lakshya with DCH is inevitable. And FA does score in many places. The story is quite simple. The setting is in late 1990s - just prior to the infamous Kargil. Roshan is Karan Shergill, the younger sibling in a well to do Delhi business family. Karan is a happy-go-lucky naive kid who has nothing to worry about in his life. His lady love, Romila Gutta aka Romy (Zinta), on the other hand, is a career minded young lady who has a clear idea what to do with her life. When placed at crossroads when all his friends are deciding about their future career prospects, Karan is influenced by one of his friends' decision and plans to join the Army. And to his own surprise finds himself in the Army training school. However, this sudden transition from his Bohemian lifestyle to army life proves to be more than he can handle and he quits the course. However, Karan realises that things will never be the same again with Romy, who clearly sees him as a quitter, a loser with no ambitions, no goals(That's Lakshya in Hindi) in life. Hurt and dejected, Karan joins the Army training again and comes out as a hard-boiled Lieutenent.Karan is posted in the volatile Dras sector, Kashmir. Here meets the stiff, focused Col. Damle (Mr. Bachchan) and his troops who make Karan realize that his Lakshya is to serve the country. Before long, there is a war brewing in the mountains, with Pakistani insurgents blocking out the supplies to various army bases high up in the mountains. Karan suddenly finds himself responsible for his country's safety and plays a key role in winning the battle against the intruders. His Lakshya is met. Technically, the film is brilliant. One of the first army movies made in Bollywood without an overdose of jingoism. German cinematographer Christopher Popp captures the night war sequences beautifully. The natural beauty of the rugged Ladakh has been brought to the screen in its whole. FA is a fine eye for the minor details, e.g., the name plates on the vehicles are in white letters written on black boards, like they were prior to 2001-2. The tense screens between Roshan and his father (played by the inimitable Boman Irani) are excellent. The film was conceived very very well. However, since nothing is perfect, no review is complete without some criticism. Lakshya has its faults - and most of these are because we had expected otherwise from the director of DCH. For one, there is not much of a script, so people watching for killing time will be bored. Unlike most war/army movies, this is more of a drama. Unlike DCH, we hardly have a light-hearted moment in the movie. Javed Akthar has returned to script writing after a long gap BUT I had expected more. Second, there are too many characters. Many actors in \"special appearances\" prove to be more distractions than integral elements of the story. Amitabh has his moments, but Om Puri, Lillette Dubey and Shushant have been wasted. At points, we feel that FA had a hard time to decide whether to keep pop-patriotism away from the movie. Songs distract and do not fit in the script, unlike DCH. My rating - 6.5/10 - for the sincerity with which the movie was made, for FA's dedication to his work, and for Hritik Roshan's performance.",

It felt like a student movie about lesbian relationships in catholic schools. I am not saying that the acting was bad, it just didn't add up. And the plot is ludicrous.I understand this type of movie making when you are talking documentaries or biographies or films based on real events. There you can't really make an interesting and captivating story because you have to stick to history, but not here, especially when the main story is the love between a literature teacher and her student in a classy and expensive private school. One just expects more subtlety, a more elaborate plot, some sort of moral.Bottom line: one just gets bored watching it. The only way you could possibly enjoy this is if the film relates to a personal story of a similar category, like a crush on a teacher or some forbidden girl love episode. If this film meant something for the movie maker, it certainly did not manage to relay the same feelings to the viewer.",

The main leads are for Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon. Furthermore we have Laurence \"Morpheus\" Fishburne, Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden. The movie itself is very dark and sober without much music. The story is brilliantly written and the acting is without any doubt superb.I'm glad Sean Penn finally won an Academy Award, he's a brilliant actor and he certainly deserves the recognition. Tim Robbins was good as well, but I think Benicio del Toro should have won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. His performance in \"21 Grams\" was much more superior to Robbins' performance in \"Mystic River\". Anyway, that's just what I think. Kevin Bacon was excellent as well and he is one of the most underrated actors of his generation. Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney were good as usual.Although I very much enjoyed this movie, it didn't exactly turned out to be the masterpiece I was expecting. But that's maybe because this was only the first time I watched it. Anyway, I'm still looking forward to see Eastwood's masterpiece of this year: \"Million Dollar Baby\".

Selick's screenplay is excellent and faithful without being a carbon-copy of Gaiman's story, and Selick adds some of his own dialogue to the film, so his contribution is most certainly not only visual, and chooses which dialogue to use from the novel wisely. Less of a horror story than the novella and more of a dark fantasy, \"Coraline\" features a well-written and well-drawn lead character and brings the novel's bizarre world to life without compromise. The film's fantasy world grows more bizarre each time we see it, and is as discomforting as it is fun. I missed the singing rats from the novella, but this was more than compensated for by the visual splendor of the garden scene, and there are numerous other examples of the changes from the novel making total sense as Selick's vision of the story differs from Gaiman, but doesn't betray the original work of art, only compliments it. The voice cast is very good and one cannot praise the spectacular animation enough. I was very pleased with the 3D presentation here, it was very, very rarely (only once or twice) used as a 'cool effect', and overall was very tastefully used to give the visuals more depth. Perhaps the first really good film to have a wide release in 2009, and looking at the next few weeks I see more than one film I'm moderately interested in, so this might end up being a pretty good year.",

    "review": "Preity Zinta's fabulous performance...\nAfter having a successful turn with Kya Kehna, Kundan Shah and Preity Zinta reunite for another picture that revolves entirely around her. This is a film that has it all: comedy, drama, emotions, romance and values. It is portrayed quite well all through, but it certainly wouldn't have worked if not for Preity Zinta. Don't know what it is about her. Watching her on-screen is a refreshing, encouraging experience. Her bright smile, her easy charm, her strong and natural screen presence, and her real-life happiness that translates so naturally onto the screen, all make you believe that life is beautiful. Even when she's sad and you see tears in her expressive eyes which naturally sadden you as well, you cannot but feel optimistic. She switches sorrow with happiness quickly yet convincingly. This is not just the beautiful character she's got, it's Preity herself. Not once has she been called a bubbly and vivacious actress. Her ability to inject even the saddest of characters with her natural zest is unique and commendable. Not many actors can do it, but Preity can.Preity plays Shalu, a girl who is the product of her father's extramarital affair, and who was adapted by her father's wife (Rekha) after his death. Unaware of her identity, she often wonders why her mother does not show even remote affection for her while clearly doing so towards her sister Nimmi (Mahima). Yet, her love for both her mother and her beloved sister is immense and unconditional. As a matter of fact, the bonding and camaraderie between Shalu and Nimmi is one of the most beautifully portrayed sibling relationships and rarely done so convincingly in mainstream films. Shalu never for one moment begrudges her sister for being their mother's preferred child. On the contrary, she is presented as that happy-go-lucky girl who is full of life no matter what. While troubled by her mother's cold and aloof attitude, she does not spend time crying for all ill fate; she fights for her happiness and makes her best to prove her worth. Later in the film, her ability to sacrifice her own happiness for her sister and family brings a new dimension to her, and while it could have made any other actress look cheap and pretentious, Preity is compelling and moving.Shalu is a very simple yet extremely memorable role, and she's unlike any leading lady you've seen in Hindi movies. She is very much a real person, who wears regular everyday clothes (western but not in the glamorous or vulgar sense, as one would imagine), rides a bicycle, slides down the staircase banister, confronts her mother's political rivals, has absolutely no qualms about lying when applying for a new job or trying to get what she wants, and sometimes even likes to play pranks on strangers. Indeed, a character archetype that would be considered too racy or even unseemly for leading ladies just a few years back. But here there's no contradiction between Shalu's independent nature and her commitment to her family. Shalu, if you like, is your girl-next-door, but not the naive one; she is a young, strong woman who knows her mind but has her values intact. Preity integrates her boyish charm into Shalu's mini-negative shades, providing some moments of light, comic relief, as in the scene where she misleads Arjun Rampal's character on his way to the company, or the ones where she mistreats him (\"Hey Driver! Ksh! Ksh!\"). Even the early sequence where she feeds her mother's political rivals a peppered pastry (by the way, the instance when they have smoke coming out of their ears is redundant and annoyingly embarrassing) is entertaining.",

    "review": "Going to the movies is a wholesome experience for me. I look forward to the movie as soon I have my tickets booked. I have certain expectations from the movie and I switch off the outside world along with my cellphone as I settle in to watch the movie. This is how I settled down yesterday evening to watch this movie called Boom. The movie promised to have the elusive right mix of oomph and a real story coupled with good actors and behind it all a director who has been threatening to deliver for a long time. The spin-doctors had given good publicity to the movie by making sure that its every round to the censors was well publicised along with the usual comments on whatever happened to freedom of expression and self-censorship.The two hours of the movie passed in a whirl and it was difficult for me to conclude on what was worse- the movie or the audience. I for once pitied the censor board who has to see such junk like this in its raw form and then be criticised for censoring parts of the movie. I also came out of the movie with significant additions to my knowledge bank- I got to know, for example, that a bag of cement costs around 100 rupees or so and can be delivered the next day morning if it ordered around 7pm. How I know is because the person next to me was a cement dealer and obviously likes to conduct his business on the phone in a cinema hall when he is not whistling or nudging his partner everytime he saw a bikini on the screen. In addition, if I missed a double meaning dialogue in the movie then I only had to concentrate on the animated conversation behind me to hear it again amid a thousand giggles. With such wholesome entertainment all around me who wants to see the movie.\nNot that there was anything in the movie to watch. It's amazing how easily you can go wrong even if you put a bunch of talented actors on screen and some models who can also talk and a woman named Bo Derek thrown in for some more oomph. So much of oomph in that movie that I almost oomphed my way out of the hall! They were traces in the movie that reminded me of Pulp Fiction or even Sex and the City, which are both amazing productions in their own right and if only he had copied them we would have got everything we wanted. But no sir, we are too much into the East meets West syndrome these days. East meets West and takes a dive into the Pacific Ocean never to show itself again. Atleast not in the form of Boom! If this is what fusion of cultures is about I am all for pure breeds. I cannot imagine that I paid money to see a movie like this. I won't see it even if someone offered me money for this. The movie is like an orchestra in action and everything is being played out of tune and what is worse is that you can recognise what they are trying to play and that is driving you even more crazy.As for the crowd, what can I say, it deserved the movie as much as the movie deserved the crowd. Every show of skin and every raunchy dialogue were greeted with such cheers that you would assume that these women had landed in their laps! All this while cellphones were buzzing in the hall and everybody was talking to everybody else telling them they were sitting in a hall watching a movie- and what's up?Please go and see this movie and maybe it will help you appreciate how bad movie making can get. Its always nice to see the worst so we can better appreciate the good.As for the director and producer - BOOM BOOM!!",

    "review": "This movie is a true gem. Perhaps not for everyone, but those who can appreciate subtle, sensitive films will not be disappointed. In fact, subtlety is the keyword in this film. Nothing is spelled out, nobody even raises his voice, and still the story is full of emotion. It's all about small gestures and unspoken words. Take the way the viewer initially discovers that Hernan is richer and more successful than his brother Jacobo. There's nothing about Hernan's clothing or his behaviour that suggests this, but Jacobo suspects that the pair of socks his brother gave him are more expensive than the pair Jacobo gave his brother. The movie is packed with these kind of small signals, and that is exactly its strength, together with the superb acting and the nice locations (the soccer stadium!). In that way, the movie is comparable to Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki's style.",

    "plot": "Early in filming, an insecure Robert Tsai approached director Richard Linklater and tried to talk him out of letting him be in the movie because he felt he wasn't right for the role. Linklater responded that it was his very insecurity that made him exactly right for the role, and kept him in. Fittingly, Tsai's character, Lawrence, has a very similar conversation with Dewey Finn (Mr. S) about not feeling right for his role in the band.",
    "review": "Dewey Finn is a lazy freeloader and a guitarist in a rock band who plays gigs every night and sleeps every day, in his friend Ned Schneebly's apartment. One day as he shows up late for band practice he notices a new guitar player who is replacing him. Poor Dewey feels so bad about it and also about Ned and his girlfriend threatening to kick him out since he doesn't pay any of the bills. After a few days of trying to sell his guitars, which doesn't go very well, the head of a school calls and asks for Ned Schneebly, who is a talented substitute teacher with a good reputation. In a desperate attempt to getting money fast, Dewey impersonates Ned and conveniently finds himself the teacher of a third grade ( or something like that ) class for several weeks ahead. Yet another one of his crazy ideas strikes him and his plan to turn his class into a rockband to win the Battle of the Bands competition is set in motion. School Of Rock is a great feel-good comedy, fun for just about anyone of any age, kids or adults. Jack Black does carry a lot of this film on his own but I won't be too harsh on the kids in the movie, they did very well also. If anyone else should play Dewey Finn rather than Jack, it just wouldn't be the same. Since Jack is actually in a rock band in real life, and has played a few characters in films before who are also into music, he just seemed to fit right into this film. His real passion for rock music helps a lot in this film, and makes Dewey Finn one hell of a good character. The plot to this film is really good I think and Mike White did a great job on the screenplay. As did Linklater on the direction of the film.This comedy should not be ignored just because there are kids in it, I enjoyed it a hell of a lot and you probably will too. 9/10",

    "review": "STARSKY & HUTCHI had seen this film for sale in my local DVD shop so cheap that I had to buy it. Everyone I had spoken to that had seen it had told me that this film was terrible. Every review I had read about it says it is really bad\u0085 but my attitude towards it was \"How bad can it be?\". The truth is\u0085 I actually quite enjoyed it.The movie is based on an old TV show of the same name. 2 police officers are forced to work with each other, but they are both completely different to each other. They are trying to hunt down a drug dealer that has some cocaine in his possession that is completely undetectable. Not even the police dogs can smell it.The comedy in this movie is not great. I laughed out loud once throughout the entire movie. But that is not to say it was not funny. There were a few moments in the film that made me smile and I thought were entertaining. I do wish it was funnier though. The story was quite good, but nothing we have not seen a million times before in buddy cop movies.The action as really good in places. The car chases were really good and the stunts reminded me of watching the classic TV shows that I loved as a kid, Knight Rider and the Dukes of Hazzard. It was great to see the old red Gran Torino with the white stripe along the side. I love that car\u0085 I don't really remember it from TV as I never watched the show, but I know the car. During the credits at the end, you can see some of the car stunts that go wrong during filming. These are awesome, but it is a shame to see the lovely cars getting smashed up.I like the actors in this movie. The film stars Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. These guys are funny guys, but sometimes it just doesn't work. I thought Ben played his part well and Owen played his part well too, but for some reason the chemistry between them both felt like something was missing. I could not imagine them as partners and even after watching them for 90 minutes, I still didn't really see them as partners. But nonetheless, they both did well and I enjoyed watching them. There were a lot of other famous faces in this film that I didn't know were in it\u0085 Snoop Dogg, Fred Williamson, Vince Vaughn, Juliette Lewis, Jason Bateman, Amy Smart, Carmen Electra and Chris Penn. Also I loved the cameo at the end from the original Starsky & Hutch, David Soul & Paul Michael Glaser from the TV show. I loved it and thought it was a great ending to the film.OK, so the film as a whole was not brilliant, the comedy was not up to par and the acting was not great in places, the story could have been better too but this was still really entertaining. It did not deserve the bashing by all the reviewers that it took.I will give this film 7 out of 10.\"A floater. Nothing harder to solve than a floater. No prints, body's usually bloated, it's next to impossible. All right, I say we push it out and hope the current pushes it down to the next precinct.\"For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",

Dempsey's nasal sonnets, his little brother's hustles and their parents' 30-something attitude to everything are classic.  Ranked up there with \"Weird Science\", \"Real Genius\" and \"Raising Arizona\", the original tested the times while paving new ground.\"Love Don't Cost A Thing\" is a paycheck for the producers whose idea of a good time must be making K-Mart xerox copies of ideas they wished they had first.If they have a Triple-Gold Globe Awards for the likes of Master P and Snoop's acting quality, I'll make sure to steal a cell phone and call the 900 number that gives your ghetto fabulous trash 5 Bling-Blings and two slaps across your face on GP, Uuuugh.This 'Movie' is hard to flush, let alone swallow.",

I laughed to tears over her creativity surge-- she very accurately portrayed that kind of grief over a relationship lost... amazing!  I must say however, that if I were in a position to choose between Keannu Reeves and Jack Nicholson.. well there's no decision to make--the young stud muffin would win in a heartbeat!...(although Jack really was quite charming once he got over being such a putz)..

    "review": "On the one hand there are many delightful moments in THE POLAR EXPRESS, not the least of which is the entire look of the film--appealing in a way that great illustrations of children's books always are to young and old. Tom Hanks and the others enter into the spirit of the whole thing with gusto--and all the performances are right on target.On the other hand, much of the film is an excuse to dazzle with roller-coaster-like rides on the express train that roars across various landscapes making wild leaps and turns, all the while thrilling us with a sense of adventure and excitement. For the very young, the ride might be a scary one, especially when the daring young hero rides atop the train during a blustery snowstorm.Things barely quiet down once the destination is reached at the North Pole. Still there are dangers lurking and the thrills continue with some amazing photographic tricks that can only be done in this new process of computer generated animation.And to add a cozier touch to the proceedings, certain famous Christmas songs are interjected at intervals to give the North Pole--and the film--a warmer glow.All in all, quite an imaginative and innovative achievement--impressive enough to assure its place among future Christmas favorites with unlimited appeal for the young in heart. The message of Christmas is lightly hinted at but when Tom Hanks as the train conductor tells the little boy, \"The true meaning of Christmas is in your heart,\" we can be assured that children everywhere will definitely \"get it\".Visually, it's a stunner. I didn't see it on the IMAX screen where I imagine it really knocks your socks off, but at a multiplex where picture and sound were impressive enough to convey just how advanced special effects technology has become. There is much artistry involved here, especially when the night scenes of the train's fast-moving travel through a blustery snowstorm capture some rich winter landscapes, including a frozen lake that threatens to demolish train and passengers before danger has passed. The camera-work is continually fascinating as is the artwork involved.A pity there couldn't have been more of a story in the children's book which is the source--but the artistic visuals are the main source of entertainment here and they are superb. The busy background score by Alan Silvestri is reminiscent of works by John Williams. Although none of the sprightly song tunes are particularly memorable, there is a wistful quality to one of the new Christmas ballads sung by the children.P.S. - I have just watched it on DVD, a year after writing the above review--and it's definitely a keeper--just as wonderful as you could want, an amazing technological achievement that should delight all ages who can still hear that bell! Tom Hanks, as the conductor, is my favorite character--brilliant job.",

    "review": "Exciting things are afoot in Indian cinema: a new cadre of filmmakers has appeared over the past ten years and is using the cinematic medium in fresh, innovative ways for a specific urban audience.  Even the language they use is new: big cities like Bombay, Calcutta, Bangalore, and Madras have always displayed a propensity for English, albeit an English infiltrated by peculiarly Indian locutions and idioms.  Urban folk switch back and forth between Indian English and the vernacular depending on the situation and conversation partner.  A curious linguistic hybrid has sprung up: Hinglish-a blend of English and Hindi-and the new breed of filmmakers allows their characters to speak in this energetic, all-embracing patois to grant them greater relevance and immediacy for the urban Indian viewer.  Films like `English August', `Bombay Boys', `Split Wide Open' may not have been outstanding films, but they broke new ground in terms of subject, approach, and characterization; they unapologetically reflected the metropolitan mind-set and made no attempt to be all things to all people, for they probably would never play in small towns or villages.  However, international audiences would relate to these films for they described life in the big city, and city dwellers, regardless of geography, share a complicity with other city dwellers.  Thus these films have become staples of the international film festival circuit.Nagesh Kukunoor belongs to this class of filmmaker and made his debut with `Hyderabad Blues', followed it up with `Bollywood Calling' and `Rockford', and now has presented us with `Teen Deewarein' (Three Walls).  I have not seen the films that preceded `Teen Deewarein', but if this effort is anything to go by, Mr. Kukunoor is well on his way to becoming one of the new auteurs of Indian cinema.  He has written, produced, directed, and if this were not enough, cast himself in one of the lead roles in `Teen Deewarein'!   Naseeruddin Shah, Jackie Shroff, and Juhi Chawla--the headliners--are  well-known names in Indian cinema; what's new, however, is that Jackie and Juhi have never before attempted cinema of this sort.  For years, Jackie was a stalwart leading man of Hindi films, singing, fighting, and romancing his way through several identical, lucrative, yet undistinguished potboilers.  Likewise, Juhi has been a capable, if standard, leading lady: glamorous, competent, but never truly challenged by her roles. Also, she was made to simper and giggle in far too many films for my liking.  Naseeruddin Shah, however, has made a career of doing daring and different roles; he switches back and forth, seemingly without effort, between lead and character roles, and has frequently appeared in experimental films.  He had great fun as the boorish, scary underworld don who turns filmmaker in `Bombay Boys', and just as easily, was the emotional core and the conscience of Mira Nair's `Monsoon Wedding'.\nIshaan (Naseeruddin Shah), Jaggu (Jackie Shroff), and Nagya (Nagesh Kukunoor) are a prison's three inmates on death row.  Gulshan Grover is the humane warden attempting reform of the archaic penitentiary system, while Juhi plays Chandrika, a filmmaker making a documentary on death-row prisoners.  The three men are each accused of killing a woman: Jaggu is alleged to have stabbed to death his adulterous spouse, Nagya is accused of pushing his wife under an oncoming truck, while Ishaan has accidentally shot a pregnant teller in a botched bank robbery.  The three men cannot be more different in character and in their responses to the death sentence. Jaggu, overcome by remorse, wishes to embrace death in atonement for a crime against society.  Nagya stoutly denies having pushed his wife and steadfastly believes that truth will prevail, despite the fact that the execution date looms closer with every passing day.  Ishaan, the only career criminal of the three, maintains a cheerful outlook and prepares to break out of prison because he doesn't believe he should be put to death for an accidental killing. Chandrika manages to get permission to interview and film the three men, and as time progresses, gains their trust.  We see how each of these characters is a prisoner--the three men are literally behind bars, while the filmmaker is trapped in a horrible marriage.  Once these four characters come together, we get uncontrived ruminations on life, death, love, and relationships.  Juhi switches her camera on and unobtrusively elicits her subjects' life stories and philosophies.  The men respond to her gentle approach and open up gradually and pour out their hearts to her non-judgmental camera.Despite the fact that the prison warden has put many reforms into place, it is still a prison, and we see the dehumanizing effects of incarceration. As always, the strong pick on the weak, and predators have their choice of prey, for there is nowhere to run.  A homosexual rape takes place, but the HIV-positive rapist gets off with a beating; his brother is a member of the state legislative assembly and his clout extends to the prison system.  As the days go by, the documentarian finds her objectivity getting compromised. Through her, we get to know the men, and find it impossible to impersonally look at them as prisoners who are about to get what they deserve.Outstandingly well-written in a seamless mix of English, Hindi, and Hyderabadi dialect, the film is equal parts polemic against the death penalty, human interest story, and quite unexpectedly, suspense thriller. It is photographed in a gritty unglamorous manner, probably on digital video, with much steadicam use, so that we walk beside the prisoners and feel their claustrophobia and despondency.  The leads, blessed with a literate, intelligent script, offer up detailed character studies. Naseeruddin Shah, like the great Charlotte Rampling, merits the prefix `the always amazing'.  His Ishaan is a complex, paradoxical creature-shot through with a rumpled charm, he is a self-serving grifter and an ace at camouflaging his true emotions, but there is unpredictable decency, as well. The surprises, for me, were Jackie Shroff and Juhi Chawla, who, happily, have strayed far from the safe and known domain of conventional commercial Hindi cinema.  Jackie turns in a finely nuanced performance of a man who regrets having committed a crime of passion.  As a successful lawyer, Jaggu is the most educated of the three and late at night, he ruefully composes melancholy poetry to soothe his troubled soul.  Juhi Chawla is a revelation. Gone are the juvenile giggles and irritating mannerisms; with this role, Juhi has stepped into glorious maturity and tackles a role fraught with adult problems and issues.  Perhaps realizing her lot is not much different from the prisoners, her face registers outrage at their plight and the corruption-filled higher echelons of the system. Chandrika convincingly makes the transition from impartial spectator and archivist to outspoken activist.  Her new political awareness empowers her to stand up to her abusive husband; in fact, the confrontation scene is a highlight of the film.Nagesh Kukunoor deserves a paragraph of his own.  This over-achieving, hardworking young man has conceived of a most novel story, produced with great flair, and directed with enormous sensitivity and cunning a film that will be remembered for a long time.  He had the good sense to populate his film with outstanding actors, and it is here, unfortunately, that his shortcomings as a performer surface.  Had there been merely mediocre actors around him, Nagesh Kukunoor would probably have shone.  However, in the august company of Naseeruddin Shah, Jackie Shroff, Juhi Chawla, and Gulshan Grover, he is shown to be the acting rookie that he is.  This is a very minor quibble, for his acting is not bad at all.  I just feel he had enough on his plate already, and should have cast another, more seasoned actor in the role of Nagya. It would have taken the film up another notch, but in the face of so much excellence, it is a very small cavil. `Teen Deewarein' is a most satisfying film experience.if only it had been accorded the good fortune of a big release that undeserving schlock like `Mein Prem Ki Deewani Hoon' received, it might have made the world's movie-going public sit up and take notice.

    "review": "Bhoot is one of the Ram Gopal Vermas milestone, and also the only good movie which is of genre horror and also a professional Bollywood film. Before Bhoot, the horror movies made in Bollywood were mostly will fit in comedy. Off course, other than Ramse movies, some serious tries were made like Ankahee and others. But they failed to get attention of the audience or to get good reviews and critics. Even Ramu's previous movies Raat and 'Darna Mana Hain' failed to get any attention. So before watching Bhoot I have prepared for a movie which will scare you less and make you sleep more. But I was totally wrong. The movie doesn't have ghosts with painted faces, neither it has females wearing bare minimum clothes and throwing other people around like basketball, neither it has Mantriks with skull in their hands. It is a very simple low budget movie. It is more comparable to Kaun than any other Bollywood horror movies you have seen. Most of the credit goes to the Director, and remaining to the actors, specially Urmila. Urmila is the main character and mostly the story revolves around her, and she fits there so well. Ajay and Nana were as usual at their best leaving us with nothing to curse for. Ajay a simple, middle class husband who is totally helpless and got no clue of what should be done, while Nana a 'Chakram' police inspector who has doubt that something weird is going on. These two characters too are plotted very well, and done with the same power by the actors. Another good aspect is its short length. The movie starts quickly, without showing us any love story and song. A couple getting into a new apartment house, which is haunted, and the wife gets possessed by the ghost. Its just one line story. The most important aspects of ghost stories is the environment making, and thats the most positive part of this movie. Just the sound of lift coming up and down makes so much of impact. I will recommend this movie to everyone, who enjoys Bollywood movies, and also to those who enjoys horror movies. In my opinion, this movies should go in \"101 must watch Bollywood movies\" as it is the only good horror movie made in Bollywood till date.",

A gem of a movie by the director Raman Kumar.Saath Saath got released in 1982 with the charming next door pair of Farooq Sheikh and Deepti Naval and the timeless ghazals and nazms penned by Javed Akhtar, composed by Kuldeep Singh and sung by Jagjeet Singh and Chitra Singh. The story portrays how the might of money and hardships of life get the better of the ideals of an idealistic person. However a girl loving not just him but his ideals is not ready to compromise on this count for the sake of love, family or anything. When she is about to leave him, then he realises that he had digressed from his right path, his ideals. And then he stops his wrong steps getting the Saath or the state of togetherness with his sweetheart in return. The punchline of the movie comes in the end - Love does not mean looking at each other, it means looking together in the same direction. This punchline sums up the plot of the story and the intention of the storyteller.The story starts with the college life love of Farooq and Deepti in which there are teasings and light moments provided by their buddies. After their love marriage, starts their hard life in which they hardly get any time to see each other, leave aside talking. All this has been portrayed in a highly emotional, natural and loving manner. Family responsibilities and circumstances lead Farooq to work in association with Satish Shah, a corrupt publisher whose thoughts centre around enhancement of cash inflow, by whatever means possible. Deepti who had married Farooq for the sake of his ideals only because his idealism was the foundation stone of her love towards him, is dumbfound to see the change in her husband and lover, courtesy the job and the company of Satish Shah. Farooq is getting more and more transformed from an idealistic person to a money-minded person, looking a pale shadow of his college days. Deepti's objections are not affecting him and this is something even more painful for Deepti. Finally Farooq's decision to get involved in publication of pornography proves the proverbial last straw on the camel's back for Deepti. She decides to leave him and his home and then only curtain fallen on the eyes of Farooq gets removed and he is able to see where he faltered.The story and its narration both are heart-touching. The transformation of Farooq from a man of principles and ideals to a money-minded person has been shown quite realistically. It has reminded me of a legendary Hindi novel - Jhootha-Sach written by Yashpal which shows similar transformation of a patriotic and idealistic freedom-fighter in the wake of the changed scenario post independence. Farooq who says a SHER in the beginning - 'MAANA KI MAIN MAJBOOR HOON, LAACHAR NAHIN HOON, INSAAN HOON, BIKNE KO MAIN TAIYAR NAHIN HOON' (I am hard-pressed ,yet not compelled to follow the wrong path, I am a human-being who is not ready to be sold for money), becomes more and more money-minded later on, giving justifications for his wrongdoings; looks utterly real. In the ending scene when Farooq conveys Deepti his decision to leave the wrong path and join his roll model, A.K. Hangal's newspaper, Deepti asks him whether he is doing it just for her sake; Farooq's reply simply touches the heart of the viewer - 'NAHIN, APNE LIYE BHI AUR UN SACHCHAIYON KE LIYE BHI JINHEN HAM DONO NE MILKAR PYAR KIYA THA' (not just for your sake, for own sake also and also for the sake of those truths we had loved together).The music of this movie is timeless, the performances of the lead pair Farooq and Deepti with the complete supporting cast are heart-warming, art direction and background score are perfect and good editing has kept the movie crisp and engrossing. A perfect movie.Saath Saath reminds you that when you love somebody, it is not just physical love or the love for his or her outer persona, the true love happens for the character, thoughts and inner nature of that person. That love remains intact only when both the lovers continue to look together in the same direction. That togetherness only matters and not just the physical togetherness. I strongly recommend Saath Saath to all those who are fond of watching good, intelligent and inspiring movies and have not watched this masterpiece yet.",

    "review": "The basic storyline of 50 First Dates: Henry Roth lives in Hawaii and spend his time wooing women who are visiting the island, simply because there is little chance of commitment. Then he meets Lucy Whitmore. One day they hit it off, and the next she doesn't even recognise him. It turns out that she suffers from short-term memory loss, and every day he tries to win her over once more. Firstly, I have to say that 50 First Dates is a really funny film. It isn't overly stupid, but it's not subtle either. But underneath the humour is where I believe this film's true beauty lies. It shows love in a way that I have never seen in another film before. From the way that her family sacrifices everything to keep her happy, and blissfully unaware of her condition, to Henry who, despite the fact that he could have just about any woman that he wanted, decides that he wants to be with Lucy, regardless of the fact that he has to meet her for the first time every day. Henry's character undergoes somewhat of a transformation in front of our eyes. The film starts off with him coming across as somewhat of a pig (well, to us women anyway :)), and by the end of the film, we truly admire him. He even sacrifices his dream so that he can be with Lucy, and help her to move on with her life. The film isn't really predictable, either. For example, I spent the entire films assuming that the ending would be somewhat different. Although romcoms almost always have happy endings, this one damn near had me in tears. And it wasn't even sad. I never knew what a feel-good film was until I saw this...highly recommended.",

    "review": "What can I say about Chalte Chalte?The cast was excellent as were their portrayal of the individual characters, with Rani shining out the most. She has come a long way from her days in Ghulam, and with her last few performances, she is sure to take the place that Kajol held. She looks classic, acts flawlessly in both emotional and comedic scenes and seems natural. SRK, what is there to say about him hat has not already been said - he is on par with his other performances.\nThe story is entertaining and patchily scripted with a few flaws and surprises. I have to say that I expected a lot out of this movie, but inevitably it was a concatenation of a other bollywood movies with storylines being nicked from movies such as Saathiya, DDLJ and Hum Tumhare Hai Sanam. Never the less, the songs were good, direction was professional and it was good to see other locations apart from Switzerland.I had to issues with this though: 1 - why did they not use Johnny Lever to his full potential?2 - why is it necessary to have a happy ending? Priyas own words were: even though you love each other it is sometimes not possible for a couple to be together. This is a way of live. With their excellent portrayal of married couple squabbles, it was unjust to say that they would forget everything and go back to being a happy couple? IF they had separated as couples do, it would have being a truly realistic movie and a step for bollywood in acknowledging that all things are not lubby-dubby.",

Imagine True Lies meets Grease meets Toy Soldiers meets Never Been Kissed meets Matrix. I know it has been parodied so many times, but that slow-mo back ward flip when Shar Rukh Khan tried to evade the Spitty teacher's bullets ala Matrix really cracks me up! I also liked the characterisation of the female characters in this movie. They really stand their ground against the male leads.They are not clingy and naive as I find some Bollywood movies portrays women... And no wonder... it was directed by a woman. I also enjoyed the soundtrack. Like the movie, it aims to sound contemporary while paying tribute to the traditional styles. With tongue firmly in cheek",

    "review": "The basic premise of Superman Returns is that Superman has returned from an unexplained 5-year absence to find a world that seems to be getting along fine without him, that the woman he loves has moved on and has a family, and that he is- at least in terms of any beings similar to him- completely alone. The amazing thing is, this is the least angst-filled, least melodramatic superhero film in the past 5 years or so. I think the recent trend has been to try to get audiences to empathize with their heroes more by making them more human and actually taking them seriously. Peter Parker battles some very serious demons and is in constant struggle with being Spider-man, the X-Men films are very serious and political and the latest instalment, \"The Last Stand,\" featured some startling and emotionally wrenching revelations, and Batman, well, need I go on? So, here we have Superman in the first new film in almost 20 years. He has his issues, but unlike all the other Super heroes around, he seems to be very solemn about it all. After all, he is Superman, not Clark Kent; Clark Kent is his mask. Obviously a huge nitpick people will have is that Clark comes back the very, very same day as Superman and not one single idiot in the city of Metropolis seems to notice, right? Well, yes, that bugged me too, at first. But then, the more you think about it, that's just how Clark Kent is designed: completely forgettable (except by Jimmy), always in the background, and always overshadowed by the bigger story, which is Superman. David Carradine has a very great speech about Superman at the end of Kill Bill Volume 2 that justifies everything quite nicely to me, so I suggest seeing that if you haven't already. What this movie does a great job of doing is just showing this classic, iconic super hero doing what he does best: saving the day. There's something so refreshing about finally getting that clear view of Superman for the first time after he saves a planeload of passengers from certain doom, and saying with a smile: \"Don't let this turn you off to flying, folks. Statistically it's still the safest mode of transportation.\" But that brings us to the actual plot. It goes for simple, safe, repetitive\u0097 tedious, even? And, honestly, it's the kind of plot that just doesn't justify the runtime. Lex Luthor comes up with a ridiculous plan that even in the world of comic books is pretty hard to swallow. He compares himself to Prometheus, how he is so generous with the \"mortals\" by sharing his wonderful discovery, though planning on killing billions in the process. Lex obviously forgot the last half of that story, where Prometheus is punished and confined to terrible pain for all of eternity. But maybe that's the point. I mean, we all know from the very beginning Lex won't win, he's doomed to lose, that's just how it's meant to be: Superman wins and Lex loses. Written in the scriptures: is, was, ever shall be, in comic strips, TV shows, feature films, living in an ageless universe, for all eternity.Bryan Singer is obviously aware of this. Singer also directed X-Men 1&2, and I think his biggest problem as a director is that he lacks a sense of completion in his works. X-Men is not the kind of movie that you watch, and then once it's over, you want to watch it over again. It's the kind of movie that you watch, and then once it's over, you want to see the next one. The X-Men films were each done with the presumption that there would be a next instalment, and that's fine I guess if you like always being on the edge of your seat waiting for the next one, but when his Superman movie does the same thing and drags past the 2-and-a-half hour mark, there's a problem. If nothing else, the movie establishes that Superman is indeed back, and we should expect to see more of him in the future.Superman Returns is definitely a grand film. It's big, it's loud, it's expensive. I usually don't think to myself, 'hey that looks expensive,' when watching a movie, but I did in this case. It doesn't try for anything new or bold, it doesn't want to, and it's nice to see a super hero movie where the hero is the generic do-gooder, and helps mankind because he really wants to. That's why I think Superman garners more universal appeal than any others. But, honestly, the angsty heroes can be much more interesting. Certainly so with last year's Batman Begins, which I thought was a great, perfect movie, while I though Superman Returns was really good, but probably could have been better.My rating: 7.5/10",

    "plot": "The ShenaniganZ restaurant was actually a converted Bennigan's restaurant (hence the extreme similarities). It has since been completely renovated and is now a Verizon Wireless retail store. (2009)",
    "review": "Perhaps one of the most relatable movies I'e recently seen would have to be the 2005 cult indie comedy Waiting...with Ryan Reynolds. Marking the directorial debut of former restaurant worker turned filmmaker Rob McKittrick, the movie was not well received critically but did well enough at the box office to garner a cult following. Looking on it nowadays, this is one of the most relatable comedies I've ever seen speaking as a former restaurant worker.The movie centers around the restaurant staff at ShenaniganZ who all go about their lives differently. There's the clueless boss Dan, the smooth talking lead guy Monty, the young guy Dean who feels like his life is passing by too soon, the flamboyant waiters, raunchy cooks, and eccentric bus boys with all their bizarre personalities. Anyone who has worked in this type of restaurant environment will be able to relate to many of the character's frustrations and insecurities, including the pressure of facing a job opportunity you don't want like assistant manager, putting up with college door room pranks in the kitchen, dealing with miserably petty customers who care less for the staff than their food, and general rage venting up from years of back breaking labour with little change in scenery. The movie is arguably at its funniest when it depicts these scenarios and it's all the more enjoyable as a result.Now since this film was made when the post American Pie gross out shock genre was still going on in adult comedies, some of the film does often rely on juvenile humor that can range from disgusting to borderline homophobic to even questionable by today's standards. Considering that there is a subplot relating to Monty and Dan hitting on the soon to be 18 year old hostess Natasha, much of the content outside of the waiting and food prep scenarios might leave a sour taste in people's mouths depending on your sense of humor. Fortunately, the general cast consisting of Anna Faris, Justin Long, David Koechner, Robert Patrick Benedict, Luiz Guzman, Chi McBride and especially Alanna Ubach as the foul tempered waitress Naomi and Dane Cook as the crudest cook Floyd make up for any gag that goes nowhere they're so funny in the film. It's saying how relatable these characters when the quiet trainee Mitch gets his time to shine at such a crucial point in the movie's third act.As this is a fairly low budget indie flick, the actual filmmaking is most reliant on standard editing to keep the flow of transitions smooth and reliant on the lunch and dinner rushes. In addition, the actual food shown throughout the movie looks appetizing enough to warrant future viewings solely for the cuisine alone, even during otherwise grossly contaminated punchlines. Of course, being a mid 2000s adult comedy, the soundtrack will instantly be dated yet fun to listen to, as nearly every number fits the scene well enough without feeling distracting. Perhaps some scenes can feel a bit too abrupt to let the song sink in on first watch, but you'll still get a bang out of the soundtrack regardless. Without feeling too try hardy in its content, this feature feels right at home as a time capsule at a time when you could get away with a lot more in adult comedies than you can nowadays.Yeah, Waiting...is as crass and juvenile as any other raunchy comedy of its time, but its central restaurant setting lets the story, primary humor and characters feel far more relatable and endearing than they could've been from a lesser setting. Sometimes, the best way to make these kinds of movies work is if the filmmaker themselves actually worked in those environments, at least so the audience won't have to. I'd say it's worth at least one viewing after nearly 20 years later, much like when you try out any other restaurant you'e never been to.",

    "review": "I'm a big fan of horror movies, but deliberately tend to avoid the ones starring A-list actors and actresses. One of the most essential yet unwritten rules of the genre states: the bigger the names involved in the production, the weaker the shocks and the tamer the blood & gore effects. If this statement were an exact science then \"Gothika\" would be one movie to avoid at all costs, with its all-star ensemble cast including Halle Berry, Robert Downey Jr., Penelope Cruz, Charles S. Dutton, Bernard Hill and John Caroll Lynch. But this really isn't a bad movie at all, in fact, and the acclaimed names seemingly didn't form any restriction for director Mathieu Kassovitz (creator of \"The Crimson Rivers\" and the brilliant crime thriller \"La Haine\"). The good news is that \"Gothika\" is a surprisingly grim and darkly atmospheric ghost story, with a handful of genuinely eerie set pieces and uncomfortable moments. Perhaps it's the influence of the French director, but it honestly feels like the movie aimed for chills & shock rather than to come across as politically correct. The bad news, however, is that the script is weak and incredibly predictable. The first twenty minutes still manage to be somewhat mysterious, but as soon as the ghost-story aspects begin to unfold, the denouement already becomes obvious to slightly experienced horror fanatics. Miranda Grey is a professional psychiatrist working in the same all-girls asylum as her husband; Dr. Douglas Grey. She strongly believes there's a rational explanation for everyone and doesn't really listens to what her patients, Chlo\u00eb in particular, have to say. Whilst driving home one rainy night, Miranda becomes involved in a nasty car accident because there's a girl in the middle of the road. Next thing she knows, Miranda wakes up as a patient in her own asylum and she's accused of murdering her husband. Shortly after, she has ghostly visions again of the girl she saw on the road, and it seems as if she's trying to tell Miranda something very important, so she better learns to really listen. Even in spite of the sadly transparent and derivative plot, \"Gothika\" manages to remain compelling and even somewhat engaging. Halle Berry is a marvelous actress (as well as one of the most ravishing women on the planet) and a joy to behold as the 'dame in distress'. She receives excellent support from the always-cool Robert Downey Jr. and I never saw Penelope Cruz deliver a better performance. If I were her, I would accept more crazy-lady roles. This certainly isn't the kind of stuff nightmares are made of, but it's a worthwhile little thriller nonetheless.",

While there are plenty of minor things I could quibble about, Miracle's ability to recapture the spirit of the Soviet upset makes it a success. A movie about this subject could easily have been a stinker, but Miracle isn't that at all. It's a great sports movie that suff
